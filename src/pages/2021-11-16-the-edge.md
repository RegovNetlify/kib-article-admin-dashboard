<p>THIS year has seen mixed performance from PRS funds across all categories due to various challenges in
    the local and global economy. These include heightened volatility in the market, the ringgit being the worst performing currency in the region and slower growth globally.</p>

<p>Over a one-year period (until Nov 30), core funds under the conventional growth category registered
    returns of -2.25% to 8.94% while shariah-compliant growth funds registered returns of 3.81% to 5.84%.</p>

<p>Conventional and shariah-compliant core funds under the moderate category provided one-year returns of -
    1.53% to 4.35%, and 2.28% to 4.37%, respectively. Core funds under the conservative category registered
    one-year returns of 1.13% to 5.19% for conventional funds and 1.60% to 2.88% for shariah-compliant
    funds. Comparatively, all core funds registered lower returns over a one-year period compared with
    last year.</p>
  
<p>Conventional non-core funds performed relatively better than their core fund counterparts, with one-year
    returns of -3.64% to 8.86%, while shariah-compliant non-core funds’ one-year returns ranged from -4.75%
    to 13.33%. Two new non-core funds were launched at end-2014, namely AmPRS-Asia Pacific REITs D
    and Kenanga OnePRS Shariah Equity Fund. The new funds provided respective year-to-date returns (as at
    Nov 30) of 10.59% and 7.40%.</p>

<p>For funds’ asset allocation, core funds follow the parameters set by the Securities Commission Malaysia
    (SC), while non-core funds determine their own level of risk. Non-core funds can invest directly in any local
    or foreign investment instrument or collective investment scheme that is approved by the SC.</p>

<p>According to independent investment research firm Morningstar, AmPRS-Conservative D outperformed its
    peers in the conventional conservative fund category, returning 5.19% over a one-year period (ended Nov
    30). According to the fund’s mandate, as at Oct 30, 80.73% of its net asset value (NAV) was invested in
    collective investment schemes, including AmConservative (37.92%), AmCash Management (20.21%),
    AmIncome Extra (11.47%) and AmIncome Reward (11.13%). The rest was invested in various sectors, and
    only 2.93% was held in cash and others.</p>

<p>Within its shariah category, Public Mutual PRS Islamic Conservative Fund returned 2.88% over the
    same period.</p>

<p>Public Mutual Bhd CEO Yeoh Kim Hong says the company’s conventional funds continue to experience
    challenging market conditions as banking and financial stocks have underperformed the broad market.</p>

<p>She attributes the higher returns of its PRS Islamic funds (as compared to the conventional funds on a oneyear return basis) to the outperformance of the FBM Emas Shariah Index.</p>

<p>“Shariah-compliant stocks performed better this year with the FBM Emas Shariah Index trading unchanged
    compared with a decline of 4.17% in 2014.”</p>

<p>As at Sept 30, Public Mutual PRS Islamic Conservative Fund had invested 59.9% of its NAV in sukuk,
    17.1% in shariah-compliant equities and Islamic derivatives, and the rest in the Islamic money market.</p>

<p>The AIA PAM-Moderate Fund came out tops in the conventional moderate category, providing returns of
    4.35% over a one-year period. As at April, 21.75% of its NAV was invested in investment funds — namely
    DBXT MSCI Asia Ex Japan 10 ETF and Investec GSF Asian Equity A — while 3.24% was held in cash and
    the rest in various sectors, including trading/services, finance and construction.</p>

<p>Comparatively, CIMB Islamic PRS Plus Moderate A returned 4.37% in the shariah category.</p>

<p>The Kenanga OnePRS Growth Fund was the best performer in the conventional growth fund category,
    returning 8.94% over this period. As at July, 69.1% of the fund’s NAV was invested in Kenanga Growth
    Fund, 28.9% in Kenanga Bond Fund and 2% held in cash.</p>
  
<p>The Kenanga Growth Fund invests in Malaysian equities, mainly in the trading/services sector (22.4%),
    short-term deposit and cash (22.0%) and industrial product (15.1%). The Kenanga Bond Fund invests
    mainly in Malaysia’s unsecured corporate bonds (58.7%) and short-term deposit and cash (27.6%).</p>

<p>Kenanga Investors Bhd executive director and CEO Ismitz Matthew De Alwis attributes the funds’
    performance to the outperformance of the underlying equity funds. All Kenanga OnePRS funds
    outperformed their respective targets.</p>

<p>“This is mainly due to stock selection as the overall market remained in the red compared with last year.
    Our strategy of overweighting the export and manufacturing sector together while underweighting
    underperforming sectors such as oil and gas and property also contributed to the outperformance,”
    he explains.</p>

<p>“Kenanga’s strategies remain focused on stock picking, while adopting a defensive strategy during times of
    market stress. Although the general market was down, sectors such as manufacturing, exports and
    selected construction companies outperformed. We scrutinised companies that still exhibited strong
    earnings growth, for example companies that benefited from the weaker ringgit and recovery in US
    demand,” De Alwis says</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he admits that volatility is an unescapable part of equity investing and the funds were
    impacted by the China-led selldown in August, though by a smaller extent. “However, we remained with our
    bottom-up strategy of adding to selected stocks on weakness and subsequently recovered the
    lost performance.”</p>

<p>De Alwis says the key challenges of managing the funds in 2015 were heightened volatility as the market
    digested numerous issues such as the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax, government
    contingent debt (1MDB) and domestic political uncertainty. Externally, the slowing growth in China coupled
    with the possibility of a US interest rate hike also weighed on sentiment. Against this backdrop, foreign funds exited Malaysia’s equity market to the tune of RM18 billion while the ringgit was the worst performer
    in the region, declining about 18% against the US dollar as at end-November.</p>

<p>In the shariah growth category, Public Mutual PRS Islamic Growth Fund returned 5.84%.</p>

<p>Across all categories, the best fund (based on returns) over a one-year period ended Nov 30 was CIMB
    Islamic PRS Plus Asia Pacific Ex Japan Equity Class A. The fund provided a one-year return of 13.33%.
    CIMB Islamic PRS Plus Asia Pacific Ex Japan Equity Class A is a non-core shariah-compliant fund.
    According to its mandate, as at October, 95.18% of its NAV was invested in a target fund — the CIMB
    Islamic Asia Pacific Equity Fund — while the rest was held in cash. The target fund invests in Asia
    excluding Japan, with 91.47% in foreign shariah-compliant equities. It mainly invests in telecommunications
    (28.50%) and consumer (24.55%) sectors. The remaining 8.53% is held in cash.</p>

<p>Munirah Khairuddin, CEO of CIMB-Principal Asset Management Bhd, attributes the outperformance of
    the fund to the process-driven portfolios that aim to deliver consistent total returns, regardless of the
    market condition. “Our research effort is focused on looking for quality companies with growth, low-risk
    balance sheet and good operating cash flows. Going forward, we intend to buy selective names on any
    significant correction.”</p>

<p>She says most of the company’s PRS funds are on track to exceed their targets. “We took the opportunity
    to diversify our funds more into the regional markets [where permissible] that benefited from the weakening
    ringgit to add value.</p>

<p>“Our PRS funds with regional market exposure have provided better returns relative to the ones limited to
    Malaysian asset holdings,” she adds. “Non-core funds have regional exposure as compared to the more
    Malaysian-centric core funds. The ringgit has depreciated against all Asian currencies year to date, adding
    favourable forex exchange gains to our Malaysia-denominated regional funds.”</p>

<p>Over the past year, most of CIMB’s shariah-compliant PRS funds have provided better returns — on a
    one-year and year-to-date return basis — than their conventional counterparts. Munirah says this is due to
    the limited exposure of shariah-compliant funds in the financial sector, for example they cannot hold
    bank stocks.</p>

<p>She also stresses that PRS funds are meant for long-term investments. “Our investors are encouraged to
    stay invested and to avoid market timing. History has proved that equity markets tend to rebound and
    recover over time, rewarding those who remain invested.”</p>

<p>Although there are PRS funds that provide spectacular returns, 23 out of 46 PRS funds have provided oneyear returns of less than 2.5%, which is the dividend payout guaranteed by the Employees Provident Fund.
    Moreover, five of the 23 underperforming PRS funds provided negative returns (see PRS table on Page 8).</p>

<p>The Public Mutual PRS Growth Fund registered one-year returns of -2.25%, which is the lowest among its
    peer funds, despite having the largest fund size (RM175,168,184 as at Oct 30). Yeoh explains that this was
    due to its more prudent approach to stock selection and the fund’s mandate of having a lower exposure to
    the foreign market compared with selected peer funds.</p>

<p>On the overall funds’ performance, she says although PRS funds have limited exposure to the Chinese
    markets, their performance was impacted as the FBM KLCI eased amid the decline in China’s markets
    during the period. “But as our PRS funds did not have a significant exposure to the oil and gas sector, they
    were not directly impacted by the downturn in oil prices over the past year.</p>

<p>“Other than comparing the absolute level of fund returns over a given period of time, investors should also
    look at the volatility of fund returns relative to other peer funds,” Yeoh suggests. “Since the commencement
    of the PRS, our PRS funds have registered less volatility or more consistent returns compared with
    peer funds.</p>

<p>“The contributors to PRS schemes should always take a longer-term view when assessing their returns for
    retirement purposes,” she advises. “It is not appropriate to measure fund performance over short-term
    periods as the positioning of funds can fluctuate depending on the period under review.”</p>

<p>There were 46 approved PRS funds as at end-November — 33 core funds and 13 non-core funds —
    offered by eight providers, namely Affin Hwang Asset Management Bhd, AIA Pension and Asset
    Management Sdn Bhd, AmFunds Management Bhd (formerly known as AmInvestment Services Bhd),
    CIMB-Principal Asset Management Bhd, Kenanga Investors Bhd, Manulife Asset Management Services
    Bhd, Public Mutual Bhd and RHB Asset Management Sdn Bhd.</p>

<p>According to data provided by the Private Pension Administrator (PPA), the central administrator of the
    PRS, the industry’s total asset under management (AUM) exceeded the RM1 billion mark as at Nov 30, up
    68% from RM500 million a year ago.</p>

<p>The PRS member base has also risen almost 34% to 167,958, PPA CEO Datuk Steve Ong says,
    compared with 111,258 last year. “Half of the new members that came on board are young contributors
    [aged 20 to 30]. It shows that they are not only concerned about wealth management but also preparing for
    their retirement capitals.</p>

<p>“Investors need to know why they are investing. They can have a higher risk appetite when investing for
    wealth management,” explains Ong. “But when it comes to retirement capitals, they cannot afford to take
    high risk as it would directly impact their retirement quality. This is where PRS as a retirement product
    comes in.”</p>

<p>He remarks that potential and existing investors should not worry about poor short-term returns or the
    current market performance and thus refrain from investing in PRS.</p>

<h3><b>A Difficult 2016</b></h3>

<p>In an environment of global economic stagnation with low growth and low inflation, fund managers will take
    on a cautious approach in their fund strategy to achieve the targeted returns. CIMB-Principal Asset
    Management Bhd CEO Munirah Khairuddin says the company expects moderate returns for equities and
    fixed income in 2016.</p>

<p>“With the government forecast economic growth of between 4% and 5% in 2016, which will be driven
    mainly by domestic demand, we will maintain our equity allocation and remain cautious. We will stay
    focused on stocks with quality growth, strong cash flows and sustainable dividends,” she adds.</p>

<p>Public Mutual Bhd CEO Yeoh Kim Hong says exports and foreign direct investments are the potential
    bright spots for Malaysia, but domestic consumption will be weighed down by increased cost of living due
    to subsidy rationalisation and higher imported inflation.</p>

<p>“As foreign investors are generally underweight in the domestic market following significant fund outflows
    from Malaysia since 2014, any upside to the ringgit and oil prices may attract fund inflows into Malaysian
    equities and help revive the market.</p>

<p>“Although the earnings momentum of the overall market may be lacklustre, selected companies are poised
    to enjoy good earnings growth due to new projects or market share gains. These are the stocks that our
    portfolios will focus on,” she adds.</p>

<p>Kenanga Investors Bhd executive director and CEO Ismitz Matthew De Alwis says, barring any major
    equity sell-offs, the company expects to see a similarly good performance for its funds in 2016, riding on
    the returns of the underlying funds</p>

<p>“The PRS funds will remain invested in the selection of underlying funds with a proven track record of
    returns to achieve the targeted returns.</p>
