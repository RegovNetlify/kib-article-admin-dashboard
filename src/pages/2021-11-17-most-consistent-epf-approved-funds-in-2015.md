For balanced fund, while almost half of the EPF-approved balanced funds beat the 7% return in 2014, most of them did not meet the consistency criteria, which is to outperform the benchmark return annually for the past 5 years. Most of these balanced underperformed the 7% return during calendar years 2011 and 2014. Nevertheless, on a long term annualised basis, some funds (see Table 2) still managed to outperform significantly.

**Conclusion**

According to EPF annual report 2014, average savings for active members at age 54 (as of end-2014) stood at RM180152.70. If one is to live till 74 years old, the amount that one can spend would approximately be RM750 per month! In consideration of Malaysians living longer, along with rising living expenses and escalating medical costs, many people might find themselves with insufficient funds to retire. As such, investors can consider putting their EPF savings with EPF-approved funds, which can potentially generate higher returns, in order to grow their retirement funds.
