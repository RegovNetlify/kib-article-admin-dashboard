<p>THE current low market valuation represents a good time for public investors to invest in unit trust
    funds as they will be able to reap a higher investment value in the long term, says Federation of
    Investment Managers Malaysia (FIMM). </p>

<p>Its CEO Nazaruddin Othman said the market valuation has been quite attractive in recent months as a
    result of a market correction.</p>
  
<p>"This would be the right time for investors to accumulate more investments into unit trust for the long
    term as they will be able to gain benefits when the market starts to pick up.</p>

<p>"The average returns of unit trust can actually surpass the inflation rate. An average return is about
    8% for equity compared to the inflation rate of between 3% and 4%</p>

<p>"It will eventually give them some returns in addition to the inflation rate so that they will see more
    value for their investments in the future," Nazaruddin told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR).</p>

<p>Nazaruddin also highlighted the fact that unit trust investment is a less risky type of investment
    compared to direct investment into stock markets due to the former's nature of having a diversified
    portfolio.</p>

<p>The capital outlay for unit trust is much lesser compared to direct investments, where the latter
    requires investors to have a significant capital to begin with their investment.</p>

<p>"On top of that, there will be a professional fund manager who will look after your investment portfolio
    compared to direct investments where you would have to rely on your own evaluation and judgement
    on stocks selection," said Nazaruddin.</p>

### **Encouraging Growth**

<p>As of Sept 30,2015, the total net asset value for the unit trust market stood at RM344 billion, where it
    grew at a 10 year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.3%, representing 21.6% of the Bursa
    Malaysia market capitalisation</p>

<p>The demand for Islamic unit trust funds has been quite encouraging as some investors would just
    invest in Shariah-based funds for religious beliefs or to stay clear from financial stocks</p>

<p>Over the decade, the total number of Islamic funds has increased from 83 funds or 24.4% of the total
    number of funds launched in 2005 to 190 funds or 30.8% as of last September</p>

<p>Islamic funds recorded a commendable 10year CAGR of 19.2%. The proportion of Islamic assets'
    value in the industry also increased by 14.3% to RM49 billion from RM8 billion in 2005.</p>

### **Extension of Incentives for Islamic Funds**

<p>The government has recently approved FlMM's budget proposal to extend the time period for the tax
    exemption on fees of managing Islamic unit trust funds for another four years until year of assessment
    2020.</p>

<p>FIMM applauded the move as it believes that the exemption will boost the Islamic unit trust funds
    industry even further.</p>

<p>"This will actually encourage more unit trust management companies to launch Islamic unit trust funds
    as they will benefit more from the tax exemption given for the fees they have collected to manage the
    funds," Nazaruddin told TMR.</p>

**<h3>PRS For The Public</h3>**

<p>Further, FIMM is also encouraging the
    younger generation to start investing in private
    retirement schemes (PRS) for their future
    planning.</p>

<p>According to Nazaruddin, the penetration rate
    of PRS is relatively low at the moment, where
    the current market size value for PRS only
    stands at slightly more than RM1 billion.</p>

<p>"The PRS progress is a bit slow compared to
    what the government aspires, which is
    RM30.9 billion by 2020," said Nazaruddin.</p>

<p>Thus, FIMM will undertake more promotions and awareness campaigns in 2016 to encourage more
    people to plan for their retirement via PRS.</p>

<p>The board has approved the establishment of a dedicated subcommittee which comprises all PRS
    providers to have a platform to discuss PRS issues.</p>

**<h3>Initiative to Benefit the Investing Public</h3>**

<p>Recently, FIMM has also embarked on another significant milestone where the regulatory body has
    called out for unit trust management companies to apply simple English in all unit trust prospectuses.</p>

<p>The move is to allow the public to have a clear and better understanding of the disclosed information
    instead of the legal, financial and technical jargon used in the prospectuses.</p>

<p>Nazaruddin said FIMM has been working with the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) and key
    players in the investment management industry to come out with the guidance to improve the quality
    of information disclosed in the prospectuses of unit trust schemes.</p>

<p>"Using plain and simple language in the documents will enable unit trust management companies to
    clearly communicate the desired messages to investors more easily and in a friendlier manner," said
    Nazaruddin.</p>
