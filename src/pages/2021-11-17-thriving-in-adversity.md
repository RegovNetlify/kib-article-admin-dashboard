<p>As Kenanga Investors Group (KIG) celebrates a year of
    remarkable achievements in 2015 amid challenging
    market conditions, the rising star now has its eyes set
    on greater heights in 2016</p>

<p>2015 may have been a tumultuous year, but for
    Kenanga Investors Group (KIG), it has been
    remarkable as it marked the third year that its flagship
    fund, the Kenanga Growth Fund – which recorded a
    21% year-on-year growth – won the Thomson Reuters
    Lipper Funds Awards for Best Performing Equity
    Malaysia Fund under its five- and ten-year category.</p>
  
<p>Ms. Lee, who is also the winner of Asia Asset Management’s Best of the Best Award for Malaysia CIO of
    the Year, attributes the success to the Malaysian-centric fund’s rigorous stock-picking strategy and its
    active asset allocation to take advantage of changing market conditions and to identify fundamentally
    attractive, off-benchmark stocks. </p>

<p>Ms. Lee recently celebrated her third-year anniversary with KIG. The London School of Economics and
    University of Cambridge postgraduate brings with her 14 years of solid experience, having previously held
    various portfolios with Meridian Asset Management, Credit-Suisse Asset Management Singapore, and
    UOB-OSK Asset Management</p>

<p>In 2015, company earnings reported one washout quarter after another, which saw the FBM KLCI
    delivering a -3.9% return as of December 31. In US dollar terms, it lost as much as 20%, reflecting foreign
    capital outflows from the country in the face of a US rate hike expectation, weak oil and commodity prices,
    and widespread political uncertainty.</p>

<p>It is against this climate that KIG went against the tide in delivering respectable returns. The stocks that
    delivered alpha performance in 2015, Ms. Lee noted, were companies that are not included in the FTSE
    Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI), ranging from sectors including technology, original equipment
    manufacturers, consumers, utilities, retail, plastic packaging. </p>

<p>These companies, she explains, are largely domestic exporters who have been experiencing improved
    demand from external markets since 2014, and have also benefitted from the strengthening USD against
    regional currencies, due to their revenue being denominated in the greenback and their cost in the
    local currency. </p>

<p>Commenting on her outlook for 2016, Ms. Lee says the equities market have largely priced in the risks
    involved, with company valuations coming down and presenting investors with emerging value. She also
    observes some semblance of stability in the ringgit since the beginning of 2016, and expects a reversal in
    corporate earnings by the second half of the year, and an imminent recovery in the oversold ringgit to drive
    positive sentiments for local equities.</p>

**<h3>Doing Things Differently</h3>**

<p>Amid weak market conditions, KIG increased its AUM by 20.37% to RM6.5 billion in 2015, with retail assets
    growing nearly 175% in two years since its retail segment was first introduced following the acquisition of
    ING Funds Bhd in 2013. It ranks No.1 in terms of percentage growth of AUM for two consecutive years,
    and remains in the top three in terms of net funds in-flow growth in 2015. </p>

<p>On winning the Rising Star of Malaysia award, Ismitz Matthew De Alwis, chief executive officer of KIG, says
    the company prides itself on being a multi-channel, multi-segment fund manager.</p>

<p>“We have an in-house investment risk analytics team which looks at what the fund does and how it
    performs. We are able to tell you why a fund is performing well or not. That is the whole development
    process and we pay extreme attention to it,” says Mr. De Alwis. </p>

<p>Kenanga’s first in-house regional fund, the Kenanga Asia-Pacific Total Return Fund, and the Kenanga
    ASEAN Tactical Total Return Fund – which target to have performance benchmark of 10% and 8%
    compounded returns respectively despite fluctuating market conditions – are something uncommon in the
    local mutual fund scene. Transparency and active involvement provided by these two funds are also factors
    that bode well with present day investors, according to Mr. De Alwis.</p>

<p>On whether KIG has any new funds in the pipeline, Mr. De Alwis emphasises that the fund house does not
    rush into launching new funds, but is more inclined towards filling the gap on what is lacking in the
    investment spectrum. He adds that KIG – currently focused on fixed income and equities – is looking at
    developing its in-house Shariah expertise and potentially different asset classes</p>

<p>In foreseeing an increasingly competitive institutional market, Mr. De Alwis concludes that the firm is
    looking at tapping the nascent retail market by encouraging more investors under the age of 40 to come
    on board. </p>
