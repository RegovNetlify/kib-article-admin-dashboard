<p>Over the past few weeks, investors around the world have been reeling from the shock of seeing
    Britain vote to leave the European Union, a move that will continue to have far-reaching
    implications globally. Following the decision, global stock markets lost about US$2 trillion in value
    the next day, and at the same time, the crisis has sent reverberations through Asian markets and
    spooked investors.</p>

<p>“In the short-run, this unexpected outcome could
    keep volatility in financial markets elevated.
    Investors will also watch for potential channels of
    contagion, for instance from a widening in
    peripheral European bond spreads to the
    banking system,” Kenanga Investors Chief
    Investment Officer Lee Sook Yee says.</p>
  
<p>“Short-term economic impact is largely centered
    on recession in the UK which will in turn dampen
    global growth.” Lee adds. While the Brexit turmoil
    will likely continue to plague Europe and some
    Asian countries that have investments in the United Kingdom, Kenanga Investors remains positive on the outlook for Asia. “While shorter term
    macro conditions like US rate normalisation and slowdown in China can present intermittent
    challenges, Asia remains a key investment destination given its size and depth of the capital
    markets. </p>

<p>“With the backdrop of low interest rates and accommodative monetary policies still largely the
    case in Asia, we feel equities as an asset class remains attractive,” Lee tells FocusM For Asia, she expects export dependent countries like Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia to
    take bigger hits, potentially shedding 0.4 percentage points to 1 percentage point of growth in
    2016, while GDP growth in China and Indonesia are expected to decline by 0.2 percentage
    points</p>

<p>Despite Asian and global economic challenges, Lee emphasizes that Kenanga Investors
    continues to solidify its presence and delivering consistent top performance for its Kenanga
    Growth Fund and Kenanga Syariah Growth Fund, both of which won the Fundsupermart.com’s
    annual “Recommended Unit Trusts Awards” for the period 2016/2017</p>

<p>She attributes the achievements and accolades received for both funds to its research
    capabilities, investment strategies, enhanced foresight, and talented pool of people. Lee says the
    recognition for Kenanga Growth Fund and Kenanga Syariah Growth Fund is underlined by the
    fund house’s commitment in assessing unit trust holders’ risk appetite, risk tolerance and
    investment time horizons. </p>

<p>To ensure growth sustainability for both funds, Lee says, proven strategies are in place, in terms
    of management. The strategy is proven by the consistent returns in the past years. Stocks are
    selected based on the business model and value proposition, management quality and balance
    sheet strength, among others she says, adding that the strategy has led the fund house to some
    under-researched investment opportunities especially those in the small and mid-cap space</p>

<p>Coming back to Brexit and its impact on equity, Lee says short term volatility warrants a
    defensive strategy. “We have turned defensive both in terms of cash holdings and stock
    selections ahead of this unexpected event. In the longer term, we expect markets to stabilise as
    central banks such as the Bank of Japan, Bank of England and the European Central Bank are
    likely to embark on more easing, while tightening by the US Federal Reserve looks likely to be off
    the table not just for July and September but probably for the rest of the year.</p>

<p>‘This implies that markets would make a comeback once the dust has settled. We advocate
    buying on dips as our earlier cash raising has enabled us to bottom fish on our weakness. Stock
    pickings remain the key with focus on sectors with earnings visibility and dividend support,” Lee
    says. </p>

<p>On fixed income, she says that fundamentally, uncertainties over global growth as a result of
    Brexit may delay a US rate hike and may even trigger easing by Bank Negara Malaysia which will
    send bond yields lower. In a risk-off environment arising from Brexit, emerging market (EM)
    currencies like the Ringgit may weaken, and this may trigger foreign selling pressures on
    Malaysian Government Securities (MGS). Past episodes of crises like the Lehman Brothers
    bankruptcy and Grexit have shown that over the medium term (six months to a year), MGS yields
    tend to fall back to levels before the crises, Lee says</p>

<p>“As a result, we see the current sell-off as an opportunity to extend duration (when favourable
    yield levels have been reached) from our currently neutral position. That said, if EM risk-off
    sentiment is prolonged, the risk of reversal of foreign flows may resurface and such an
    uncertainty might hold back the MGS from strengthening much further until rate cut expectations
    become more entrenched,” she concludes. </p>
