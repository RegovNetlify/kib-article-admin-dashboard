<p>A common trait among growth funds is that they tend to
    offer higher potential capital appreciation with the trade-off
    of above-average risk. With this in mind, the hallmark of a
    profitable growth fund is the ability to generate superior
    risk-adjusted returns in a consistent manner. Such qualities
    are embedded in Kenanga Growth Fund Series 2
    (KGFS2), which was rolled out in this year to replicate the
    success of the fund manager’s flagship Kenanga Growth
    Fund (KGF), floated 18 years ago with the aim of providing
    long-term capital growth by investing principally in
    Malaysian equities.

<p>“Above all else, KGFS2 is nimbler in size, and it can have
    up to 30% regional exposure as part of its asset allocation
    strategy. This will diversify its exposure to local and
    regional markets,” Kenanga Investors Bhd Chief Investment Officer (CIO) Lee Sook Yee tells Smart
    Investor. “An absolute return fund, KGFS2’s tactical allocation strategy enables its equity portfolio to aim for
    growth during favourable market conditions as well as capital preservation during adverse conditions.”
    Measured against a benchmark of 8% growth per annum, Lee maintains that KGFS2’s investment direction
    will be deeply rooted in Kenanga Investors’ bottom-up stock picking philosophy of focussing on companies
    with strong fundamentals and proven track records</p>

**Moving Forward**

<p>Barring the present bearish sentiment in equity markets across Malaysia and the region, the prospects of
    KGFS2 emulating the success of its “older cousin” can be considered bright judging from its stringent
    benchmarking, mirroring that of KGF coupled with the fact that that the fund is personally managed by the
    CIO, who is wellversed with local and
    regional equities
    investment. KGF has
    consistently delivered
    top performance for
    the 5 and 10-year
    period with returns of 66.49% (versus 1.39% of the FBM KLCI benchmark) and 329.95% (versus 76.03% of
    the FBM KLCI benchmark) respectively as of end-September this year. An ideal testament to KGF’s
    impeccable track record is the string of awards and accolades it has won since its inception, which
    includes:</p>

<h2>KGFS2’s allocation strategy
    enables its equity portfolio to
    aim for growth during
    favourable market conditions
    as well as capital
    preservation during adverse
    conditions, according to Lee. </h2>

<p>Brushing aside speculation that KGFS2 will be “a runaway
    success,” Lee prefers to see the fund as an initiative to
    accommodate growing demand from clients in view of the
    success of the flagship KGF, the fund size of which has ballooned
    to RM1.52bil as of end-August. “Given its size, KGF should over
    time be re-balanced to focus more on liquid bigger-cap
    companies, while KGFS2 seeks to focus more on small to midcap growth-oriented companies,” she rationalises. “With our
    disciplined approach of bottom-up stock picking, we are confident of being able to replicate the success of KGF into KGFS2.”</p>

**Perfect Timing**

<p>On a similar note, the timing of KGFS2’s launch, which coincided with
    general market weakness following Malaysia’s 14th General Election
    (GE14), does provide an excellent opportunity for investors to invest into
    the new fund. “Locally, stocks in both the large and mid-small cap space
    have been battered down on heightening risk aversion and policy
    uncertainties as the government is transitioning through the reform
    process,” opines Lee.</p>

<p>“With the market expected to stay low due to near-term volatility and
    uncertainties, opportunities abound for us to accumulate quality stocks
    at very affordable pricing.” Sustainability of business models, earnings
    visibility and balance sheet strength are among the stock picking
    parameters that have been identified for KGFS2, according to Lee.
    “Every stock in our portfolio is well-researched to the extent that we go
    beyond fundamentals and quantitative screening to meet company
    management and/or the major shareholders in ensuring each stock’s
    upside potential is intact,” she elaborates. “Generally, our portfolio
    consists of 30 to 50 stocks – with a minimum of 30 to ensure
    diversification and maximum of 50 to prevent us from losing sight of or
    focus on the stocks in our portfolio.”
