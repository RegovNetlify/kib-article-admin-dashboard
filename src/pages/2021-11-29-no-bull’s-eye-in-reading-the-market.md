<p>THE Dow Jones Industrial Index (DJIA) has scaled a dizzying height and it is both a
    boon and bane for investors (not to mention how the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq
    Composite Index have been churning out their best August performance since 2014).
    A boon because well-researched investors can continue to cash in on stock gains on
    condition that their stock selection is right, considering not all industries or sectors are
    thriving at any given time. A bane because having touched an all-time high of
    26,616.71 on Jan 26 and has ever since been holding steady above the 25,000-mark,
    the Dow’s cur-rent level heightens as much the likelihood of a market crash which
    would have dire consequences on emerging markets (EMs) given their vulnerability or
    sensitivity to any US market correction.</p>

<p>On this note, more market detractors – either out of good intent or with vested interest – have joined the
    chorus in expressing pessimism about the sustainability of the US$30 tril (RM124.06 tril) American equity
    market moving forward, presumably arguing along the basic physics law of “the higher the climb, the
    greater the fall.” One of them is John Hussman, president of Hussman Investment Trust, who has often
    been dubbed a “prophet of doom” in the stock market circle. In a recent call, Hussman, whose claim to
    fame includes forecasting the market collapses of 2000 and 2007-2008, has predicted market losses –
    backed by what he refers to as the “Iron Law of Valuation” – in the order of -64% for the S&P 500 index, -
    57% for the Nasdaq 100 Index, -68% for the Russell 2000 index, and nearly -69% for the DJIA. Even using
    the Buffett Indicator which is what Warren Buffett, mogul of the Berkshire Hathaway empire, uses to get an
    overall feel for the valuation of US stocks, there are already tell-tale signs that the market is overheating. </p>

<p>Derived from the simple metric of just dividing the total market capitalisation of all US stocks (US$30.4 tril)
    by the latest gross domestic product (GDP), the current reading (as of Sept 3) of 148.9% is even higher
    than the 145% peak during the dotcom bubble era in the 1990s (which fell by 49% in March 2000) or 110%
    prior to the 2008 global financial crisis. While this indicator does not necessarily mean that the tides will
    turn anytime in the near future, it may be a smart idea for investors to chart their journeys a little
    defensively. </p>

**Nobody Can Outdo The Market** </h3>

<p>It is very common that even seasoned market forecasters often get their prediction either awesomely
    accurate or awfully miscued (otherwise they will no longer need to issue disclaimers at the end of their
    analysis). The truth is that no stock market metrics are 100% reliable at predicting corrections, crashes,
    rallies or stagnant stock markets. Otherwise, everyone would know exactly when to buy, sell and hold their stocks in order to maximise their profits. In this regard, look no further than our ‘super’ investor-cumphilanthropist Koon Yew Yin who was humble enough to own up (in his blog) that he erred in buying too
    many shares of a certain main board counter. </p>

<p>He attributed his
    bullishness to his
    previous investments
    “which had gone up a
    few hundred percent
    within 2.5 years.” As he
    bought the shares of
    that particular stock on
    margin financing, he
    has no better option
    but to dispose his
    holding at a loss when
    faced with margin calls
    (to complicate matters,
    the price of the stock
    dipped after it lost a
    court case). On a
    similar note, the 85-
    year-old savvy investor
    has also decided to
    stop posting his stock
    investment tips on a popular online forum effective Aug 31 to “avoid seeing senseless criticisms.” </p>

<p>“Many a time, when I post buy recommendations with good intention, a few readers would say that I want
    them to buy so that I can profit off of them,” he pointed out in what he described as his “last sermon on
    share investing.” “But you must remember that even good shares with very good profit growth prospects do
    not move up or down continuously without temporary short-term corrections,” he added. </p>

**Current Market Trends** 
</h3>

<p>While every stock (or fund for that matter) has its own peculiarity (distinguishable patterns), it has to be
    accepted that – given that today’s markets are inter-linked in many ways – the ability of a counter to
    outperform at both share price and profitability levels very much hinges on external as much as internal
    market developments. The recent US Federal Reserve’s tendency of raising interest rates faster than
    expected has undoubtedly made emerging market assets less attractive. </p>

<p>Such a situation is further exacerbated by the recent financial crisis in Turkey – the country’s worst
    currency crisis since 2001 – which will likely reduce investors’ appetite for riskier assets while intensifying
    the movement of foreign capital from higher-yielding assets (i.e. hedge funds) to relatively safer ones (i.e.
    defensive stocks) in developed markets. Against such a backdrop, the greenback has been appreciating
    strongly – even against the ringgit – this year. On top of that, concerns over China’s economic slowdown
    and intensifying global tensions have fuelled anxiety about the global economic growth and corporate
    earnings outlook. </p>

<p>Emerging economies that are reliant on external
    borrowings to fund economic growth and large
    current account deficits such as Turkey and
    Argentina are feeling the heat. Year-to-date, their
    currencies have depreciated about 40% against the
    US dollar. Moreover, with trade disputes as well as
    tighter US monetary policy dominating headlines –
    and with both the US and China in the late stages
    of an economic cycle – some volatility is to be
    expected for the remaining months of 2018.
    However, there is a silver lining in that the tone is
    much more upbeat from a fundamental perspective.
    Many EM countries – especially in Asia – appear
    healthier with improving current account balances
    as well as lower external debt to GDP ratio. Ongoing structural reforms in major economies notably
    China and India are also likely to boost sustainable
    long-term growth.</p>

**Reading The Market**</h3>

<p>Wonder how many investors would recall that the Dow plunged 2.5% or some 666 points to 25,520.96 on
    Feb 2 – and suffered its worst week in two years – as concerns over rising interest rates and inflation from
    a perceived overheated US economy triggered a long-feared sell-off. It was the worst day for stocks since
    President Donald Trump took office and also rather a grim reminder that the market has been on a historic
    nine-year bull run. All-in, excluding the Feb 2’s plunge, there have been 17 times when the Dow had
    declined 500 points or more in a single day over the past 25 years (since 1993). Although the tendency is
    such that the benchmark market index tends to rebound the next day or the following week, one should
    bear in mind that past performances do not always equal future returns. In other words, should interest
    rates continue to soar, they could trigger sell-offs that buck historical trends. </p>

<p>Whether that stock market cycle hypothesis does hold water or otherwise, one thing for sure is that
    intermittent market shocks and swings (e.g. currently market is down due to trade tensions between US
    and China) is inevitable. While a gung-ho investor relishes the thrill of betting his last penny on a strong
    upward trajectory till a more obvious tell-tale sign of a crash looms, investors with low risk appetites would
    have already commenced their ‘market descent’ measure, particularly by exiting their holdings of
    speculative stocks while maintaining (or even increasing) their holding of high dividend-yielding counters. </p>

<p>Whatever the case is, nothing beats having a versatile back-up plan at all times, for even in the most
    bearish of markets a genius investor is still capable of pouncing on the slightest opportunity in sight to reap
    handsome gains. In essence, the science of technical analysis (or fundamental analysis) has to be
    streamlined with investment psychology given economic cycles, market exuberance and stock market
    swings are many a time heavily linked to human psychology of greed and fear. While there are painful
    market crashes, investors tend to have short-term memories – deliberately or otherwise. Soon, greed will
    step in and wash away memories of past crashes, while pushing investors to drive the economy and stock
    markets into fragile bubbles once more. And the cycle repeats itself endlessly. </p>
