<p>Themed Credible Malaysia, Dynamic Economy, Prosperous Rakyat,
    Budget 2019 which also went down into history as the maiden budget
    under the Pakatan Harapan Government, was tabled by Finance Minister
    Lim Guan Eng last Friday (November 2). For the fund management
    industry, Budget 2019 should be seen in the light of providing clarity on policy direction
    as well as the rolling out of reform initiatives to turnaround the Malaysian economy amid
    uncertainties of sorts in the external environment. </p>

<p>Budget 2019 should be seen in the light of providing an assurance to investors that
    workable solutions-cum-strategies have been put in place not only to lift the Malaysian
    economy out of the woods but to put the country back on the path of sustainable growth
    moving forward. There is an optimal mix of stimulus, incentives and safeguards to
    navigate what is expected to be another challenging year ahead. </p>

<p>Except for the various forms of financial aids extended to the lower-income group (the
    Bottom 40% or B40) to mitigate spiralling living cost, populist measures are kept to a
    minimum with priority accorded to addressing the nation’s excessive debt level and
    fostering long-term competitiveness with the ambition of reviving the Malaysian economy
    as an “Asian Tiger” once again.</p>

**Assortment Of New Taxes**

<p>Against a backdrop of the Government incurring a RM1.065 tril real debt and liability as
    of end-June 2018, a slew of belt-tightening measures are inevitable as the Government
    strives to oil the economy while fulfilling its social obligations.</p>

<p>Striking a balance is always a difficult exercise in the economic sense. As a trade-off for
    the abolishment of the indirect Goods and Services Tax (GST) – where a shortfall of
    RM19 billion abound (GST is projected to generate RM43 bil/year while the Sales and
    Services Tax \[SST] is targeted to generate RM24 bil/year) – it is only sensible for the
    Government to pursue other means of tax-related income.</p>

<p>One way is to pursue collection from direct taxation (i.e. corporate and personal income
    tax) or revenue sources from direct taxes even though they are vulnerable to external
    influences and can possibly fluctuate in response to the ups and downs of the world
    economy.
    </p>

<p>This explains the introduction of the following taxes (among others):
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Digital tax (effective Jan 1, 2020 on software, music, and online advertising);</li>
    <li>Gaming tax (annual gaming license fee for casinos to be raised from RM120 mil to
        RM150 mil; gaming tax on casinos to be raised to 35% of gross gaming revenue);</li>
    <li>Real property gains tax (RPGT) (5% on local & PR and 10% for companies &
        foreigners from sixth year onwards);</li>
    <li>Excise duty or soda tax (40 sen/litre to be imposed on two categories of packaged
        sweet drinks from April 1, 2019), and</li>
    <li>Levy on outbound air travellers effective June 2019 (RM20 on travellers flying to
        ASEAN; RM40 on those heading to other countries).</li>
</ul>

<p>Nevertheless, the absence of capital gain tax can be deemed as a big relief for equity
    market. Tobacco and brewery players, too, escaped tax hikes although their joy can be
    short-lived given there had been instances in the past when taxes are imposed on a later
    date.</p>

**Lifting Construction Sector Gloom**

<p>Elsewhere, austerity measures centring on cost rationalisation involving mega
    infrastructure projects are also welcomed, although they will somehow hurt the
    revenue/profit projection of the listed contractors. The measures, among others, include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A 47% downward revision of the Light Rail Transit Line 3 (LRT3) project cost to
        RM16.6 bil (from the initial estimated cost of RM31.6 bil);</li>
    <li>Cost savings of 22.4% for the Mass Rapid Transit Line 2 (MRT2) project to RM30.5
        bil (from the initial estimated cost of RM39.3 bil), and</li>
    <li>A re-tendering of the RM5.2 bil Klang Valley Double Tracking Project which is also
        expected to provide substantial cost savings.</li>
    <li>The Government to continue with the Pan Borneo Highway project subject to a costrationalisation study</li>
</ul>

<p>That the Government reiterates its commitment to the aforementioned projects will
    somehow restore investors’ confidence in the construction sector given the KL
    Construction Index, which measures the performance of stocks under that sector has
    dipped almost 42% from 281.13 on the eve of GE14 to close at 163.34 as of Oct 30.</p>

<p>Aside from the MRT2 and LRT3, other mega infrastructure projects namely the East
    Coast Rail Link (ECRL), KL-Singapore High Speed Rail (HSR) and MRT3 will continue to
    be shelved pending future review</p>

<p>However, the same cannot be expected of the property sector. In addition to REHDA (the
    Real Estate and Housing Developers’ Association Malaysia) agreeing to slash house
    prices by up to 10% on new projects, the introduction of 5% RPGT for disposal of
    property in the sixth and subsequent years alongside the maximum 4% stamp duty from
    the previous 3% on properties worth more than RM1 mil is expected to deepen the woes
    of the sector.</p>

**PETRONAS Chipping In**

<p>Amid higher global oil prices, the Federal Government is expected to collect revenue of
    RM261.8 bil comprising a special dividend of RM30 bil from Petronas (2018: estimated
    RM24 bil; 2017: RM16 bil)</p>

<p>Essentially, the RM30 bil special dividend has enabled the Government to grow revenue
    by 10.7% to RM261.8 bil, thus containing its fiscal deficit at 3.4% or RM52.1 bil despite
    operating expenditure growing by 10.7% to RM259.9 bil.</p>

<p>While these improvements should be viewed positively by rating agencies, the fact that
    revenue will see a 2% or RM4.7 bil decline in 2019 without PETRONAS’ special dividend
    contribution could raise a red flag which ultimately become a thorn in their evaluation.</p>

<p>It is hoped that rating agencies in the likes of Fitch, S&P and Moody’s would look beyond
    the special dividend factor (or even the abolishment of GST) given the Government is
    initiating new revenue sources (vis-à-vis the introduction of new forms of taxes) or has
    embarked on major move to pare down debts and other liabilities through a concerted
    effort to plug wastages (curbing over-staffing in the civil service or payment of fat salaries
    to key personnel) and leakages (combating corruption and abuses of funding).</p>

<p>Moreover, rating agencies should also take cognisant of the following initiatives:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The setting up of a national Debt Management Office to review and manage
        government debts and liabilities, and to monitor new debt issuance by government,
        statutory bodies and special purpose vehicles, and</li>
    <li>The Ministry of Finance (MoF) to helm a special task force to review the role and
        function of MoF-owned firms and statutory bodies to avoid duplication and direct
        competition with the private sector.</li>
</ul>

**Moving Forward**

<p>On the overall, Budget 2019 bodes well for the fund management industry by having
    primarily lifted the gloom pertaining to policy direction and the type of reform Malaysia is
    embarking on to re-build its economy and financial position</p>

<p>In all fairness, it can be deemed as a decent budget that attempts to bridge the fiscal gap
    with high impact projects and targeted subsidies without negatively impacting economic
    growth and burdening the wider populace with new taxes.
    </p>

<p>Amid a brief rally which waned off in the later part of the afternoon as the tabling of
    Budget 2019 progressed, the FBM KLCI ended a commendable 6.95 points or 0.41%
    higher at 1,713.87, a harbinger that a relief rally should ensue in the days ahead
    considering that the budget was not as market-unfriendly as widely anticipated.</p>
