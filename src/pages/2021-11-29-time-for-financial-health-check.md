  Amid all the last-minute rush for the ultimate family vacation during the
  year-end
      holidays, there is a high tendency to lose sight of our financial well-being. Among
      Americans, the biggest driver of their summer overspending has been attributed to
      the lack of proper budgeting: holiday weekends, graduation parties, vacations,
      barbecues and family gatherings, summer camp, activities with the kids and back to-school shopping, among others. Doubtless, financial discipline is key to financial

<p>Amid all the last-minute rush for the ultimate family vacation during the year-end
    holidays, there is a high tendency to lose sight of our financial well-being. Among
    Americans, the biggest driver of their summer overspending has been attributed to
    the lack of proper budgeting: holiday weekends, graduation parties, vacations,
    barbecues and family gatherings, summer camp, activities with the kids and backto-school shopping, among others. Doubtless, financial discipline is key to financial
    stability; in fact, it's the magic formula in ensuring a clean bill of financial health. </p>

<p>In the short-term, financial health boils down to prioritising clear goals, making
    periodic adjustments to achieve optimum results and embarking on corrective
    action to recover from existing financial liabilities. While one need not necessarily
    be frugal or thrifty during this holiday season, especially w ith the Christmas and the New Year festivities,
    proper budgeting on holiday-cum-leisure activities seems a wise step to take. The bottom line is about
    stretching the value of every ringgit spent that is by booking air tickets or accommodation well in advance
    to capitalise on cheaper/promotional rate, simply hunting for deals online or watching out for sales instead
    of embarking on a shopping spree. </p>

<h3>**Retirement Savings VS Debt Level**</h3>

<p>For the longer term, financial health hinges on fulfilling financial commitments with ease, earning more than
    planned, spending less than necessary, saving as much as possible and investing wisely. Human
    Resources Minister M. Kulasegaran recently revealed that a large number of Malaysians - more than twothirds or 68% of Employees Provident Fund (EPF) members who are aged 54 - had less than RM50,000 in
    EPF savings. While raising the retirement age is an option that the government is contemplating, other
    means of savings, notably investing (in stocks, bonds, unit trust, gold, currencies, real estate or private
    retirement schemes) or buying insurance policies are equally vital to ensure a comfortable retirement given
    today's longer lifespan (and escalating living cost). 
    </p>

<p>In this regard, research by the Social Security Organisation (Socso) found that two in three Malaysians will
    live with less than RM950 per month until age 75, while seven in 10 will live with RM210 per month until 75
    or would have depleted their savings in less than two years. Above all else, the Socso research also noted
    that a majority of Malaysians have both low salaries and financial literacy regardless if they are
    professionals or otherwise. Inevitably, the absence of a proper money management skill will continue to be
    a bane to the so-called Bottom 40% (B40) households with a monthly income of RM3.900 and below. In all fairness, not all debt is bad debt. But debt with high or variable interest rates can make an individual less
    secure (i.e. student loan, credit card spending and mortgage balances). Interestingly, the first experience of
    debt for most people comes from their time in university. </p>

<h3>**Tax Planning**</h3>

<p>Budget 2019 has introduced a slew of new taxes following the abolishment of the indirect Goods and
    Services Tax (GST) which is replaced by the Sales and Service Tax (SST). Henceforth, proper tax planning
    is not only about upholding law-abiding citizenry but more so because tax planning is itself a critical
    component of financial planning. In essence, lax provisions have an impact on major components of
    financial planning such as education, retirement or estate planning. Staying ahead of the new government's
    new lax regime entails in-depth understanding of taxation laws and knowledge which can be rather
    technical for the layman to decipher. An easy way is to hire a professional accountant lo file an
    income/corporate tax on one's behalf although those who are more adventurous would probably choose
    the DIY (do-it-yourself) path. </p>

<p>A check on Google Search reveals that many tax specialists are offering compact courses (at affordable
    fees) for discerning individual business owners who are keen to obtain a better understanding of the
    existing taxation system. The syllabus covers, among others, small and medium enterprises (SME) lax
    incentives, small and medium industries (SMI) tax planning, tax relief for individuals, credit system for sales
    tax deduction to avoid double taxation and lower business costs, updates on SST goods exemption,
    imposition of real property gains tax, unreported income and incorrect return (remedies relief), methods by
    the Inland Revenue Board on capital statement to uncover tax evasion and changes in EPF contribution
    and relief.</p>

<h3>**Stock Market Enthusiasts** </h3>

<p>Those who dabble in the stock market should be cautious of their over-dependency on margin loans as this
    can be a double-edged sword. Two extremes to bear in mind are that one can either rake in massive profits
    alongside the raging bull or incur massive losses during a long bear market. "Most investors cannot control
    their emotions. They are egoistic and greedy. When their shareholdings are going up, they would not sell
    and like to boast to all their friends that they are so clever to have bought them at much lower prices," blogs
    "super" investor-cum-philanthropist Koon Yew Yin who admittedly over-leveraged margin financing in one
    counter whose value has plummeted 68% over a period of eight months.</p>

<p>"Now I am eating humble pie while writing this useful lesson for all investors. As much as I hate to expose
    my own mistake, I consider this lesson to be very useful and essential Lo all investors." In view of the
    highly unpredictable nature of the stock market, value investing as advocated by Berkshire Hathaway
    mogul Warren Buffett is worth considering to reap maximum rewards from one's investment. A cross
    between technical and fundamental analyses, value investing offers superior risk-adjusted returns by
    focusing on fundamentally sound companies which trade at low earnings multiples and book value as
    opposed to merely growth prospects per se. Above all else, always ensure that proceeds from one's
    investments are able to supersede current inflation rates as inflation does not only lower the worth of one's
    ringgit in the future but also tends to depress the overall returns from one's investment in equities.
