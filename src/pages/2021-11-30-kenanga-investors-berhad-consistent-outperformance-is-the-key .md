Kenanga Investors Bhd (KIB) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd. KIB provides investment solutions ranging from collective investment schemes, portfolio management services as well as segregated private mandates and alternative investments for retail, corporate, high net-worth, and institutional clients. KIB executive director/chief executive officer Ismitz Matthew De Alwis talks about his company’s fund management philosophy, and why investors should hold on to their unit trusts.

### Smart Investor: Share with us your fund management style and philosophy.

Ismitz Matthew De Alwis: We have always believed consistent outperformance comes from the application of a bottom-up stock-picking strategy and our strong focus on research, to identify quality stocks which are generally undervalued relative to their intrinsic value, or are clearly undervalued relative to their peers and overall market valuation. By doing this, we seek to consistently generate superior risk-adjusted returns, including where the ability for a stock’s price to recover after a market downturn is generally quicker than the market.

### Can you highlight major changes made to your fund portfolio over the last 12 months?

The past 12 months was characterised by extreme volatility in the equity markets. The fund had therefore maintained a defensive stance with investment level hovering at around 75-85%. The fund continued to stick to its bottom-up stock picking strategy with focus on companies with resilient earnings prospects. We reduced exposure to construction, property and materials sector due to government review of infrastructure projects and slower property launches, while increasing exposure into dividend yield stocks in expectation of monetary easing on a slower growth environment.

### How will the global economic uncertainties affect your investment decisions?

The market in general has been bearish in the past 12 months, impacted by macro events such as trade wars, rising rates in the US and uncertainties post GE14. We started the year with a view that markets should rebound as valuation has turned attractive. Although this played out up to end April, the short-term outlook has become more cloudy given the escalation of recent trade tensions. We think an eventual compromise between the US and China over a trade deal could be a re-rating catalyst. Domestically, more government pump priming efforts would be a positive for the economy and stock markets.

### How can investors get value amidst the uncertainty in equity markets?

Investors need to be mindful investment instruments such as unit trusts are for mid-to-long term horizons and so, we advise them to hold onto these instruments to realise the targeted returns at the end of their investment period. This is why investors need to invest in stocks with good fundamentals / sound undervalued counters that are able to reap longterm profits instead of chasing short-term gains often associated with “word on the street” type of investing. Diversify your investments as a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will most likely yield higher long-term returns and lowers risk of any individual holding.
