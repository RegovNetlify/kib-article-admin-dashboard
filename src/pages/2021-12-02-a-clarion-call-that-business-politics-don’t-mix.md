title: A Clarion Call That Business & Politics Don’t Mix

  “I CAN’T change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always
  reach my destination.” This
      quote by renowned country music singer and sausage company founder Jimmy Dean depicts the need for
      Malaysian capital markets to take cognisance – and for investors to re-strategise their
      portfolios – amid unprecedented market conditions in the aftermath of the 14th
      General Election (GE14). After all, Malaysia can be deemed to be in unchartered
      territory given that for the first time in 61 years, the country finds itself being
      administered by a new (but obviously not an inexperienced) government. Having
      settled down with quite a commendable performance in its first week of trading postelection, the local bourse succumbed to nerve-wracking jitters triggered by a
      revelation that the nation’s debt burden has exceeded the RM1 tril mark (the federal
      government’s actual debt and liabilities stood at RM1.087 tril or 80.3% of the gross
      domestic product (GDP) as of end- December last year, according to the Finance
      Ministry).

<p>“I CAN’T change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.” This
    quote by renowned country music singer and sausage company founder Jimmy Dean depicts the need for
    Malaysian capital markets to take cognisance – and for investors to re-strategise their
    portfolios – amid unprecedented market conditions in the aftermath of the 14th
    General Election (GE14). After all, Malaysia can be deemed to be in unchartered
    territory given that for the first time in 61 years, the country finds itself being
    administered by a new (but obviously not an inexperienced) government. Having
    settled down with quite a commendable performance in its first week of trading postelection, the local bourse succumbed to nerve-wracking jitters triggered by a
    revelation that the nation’s debt burden has exceeded the RM1 tril mark (the federal
    government’s actual debt and liabilities stood at RM1.087 tril or 80.3% of the gross
    domestic product (GDP) as of end- December last year, according to the Finance
    Ministry). </p>

<p>Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng has re-affirmed claims by Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad that
    the country is saddled by such a humongous debt level, no thanks to the 1Malaysia Development Bhd
    (1MDB) financial scandal which was further compounded by mega projects as well as the inaccessibility of
    certain accounting files to warrant a consolidation exercise. On May 23, the FBM KLCI nosedived 2.21% or
    40.78 points as uncertainties over the government debt loom, exacerbated by weakness in regional
    markets. The following day, the benchmark index erased a further 1.58% or 28.59 points to 1,775.66. What
    the Finance Minister did can be likened to a kitchen-sinking exercise – an accounting strategy to lump all
    bad news/losses at one-go so a company (a country in this context) can start with a clean slate. It can be
    deemed as a “biting the bullet” communication technique which is commonly used by a newly-appointed
    head honcho of a company to lay bare a major financial mess that he has to inherit from the previous
    management.
    </p>

<p>The idea is to release all existing bad news without further ado – but with valid justification – thus
    preventing the possibility of amassing a drip-drip effect over an extended period of time. Apparently,
    dishing out the truth has proven to be a pill too bitter to swallow (for the markets), although most wise
    investors would stand their ground on the principle of short-term pain but long-term gain. In this regard, it’s
    praiseworthy to note that the Finance Minister intends to hold firm to the CAT nobility of competency, accountability and transparency. “If by being transparent we will be punished, then there’s nothing we can
    do about it. We will still continue to be transparent,” he said, taking a swipe at an opinion expressed by a
    Bloomberg columnist that investors have been left with an uncertain fiscal outlook due to his “bluntness”. In
    fact, investors must demonstrate some degree of maturity by being able to filter the right from the wrong as
    well as not being easily spooked by truth, or to allow their buying instinct to be boosted by market rumours,
    falsehood or half-truth. </p>

**Building Confidence</h3>**

<p>One would have asked, with so many blue-chip stocks getting bruised and battered – inadvertently, the
    recent sell-down was overdone with massive dumping by foreign funds – wouldn’t buying opportunities of
    sorts abound for local funds/institutions or even retail investors? For a fund manager, this is not as simple
    as considering a “top-down” approach (analysing the economy, followed by the industry and then the
    company) or embark on a “bottom-up” approach (analysing the company and move up to the industry
    prospects and ultimately the economic forecasts). Neither is it about which of the two approaches would
    yield better results in terms of ringgit and sen.
    </p>

<p>Realistically, there is even a pressing need to weigh the extremely fluid political/economic environment that
    has presented itself post-GE14. Far from doubting that the newly-elected Pakatan Harapan government is
    able to fulfil its rather ambitious election manifesto within 100 days in office, the trump card lies in building
    and sustaining market confidence. Until the so-called financial messes related to 1MDB scandal are
    unearthed and the wrongdoers are prosecuted, investors from retail to institutional as well as foreign funds
    simply have to adjust and anticipate more shocking or market-unfriendly revelations. Undoubtedly,
    witnessing the recent stock market bashing, the extent of the ringgit slide against the greenback or the
    outflow of bond funds is an unpleasant sight.</p>

<p>But regardless of the pain, nothing beats the aspiration to uphold policy transparency and clarity on
    economics and financial-related matters. Henceforth, the government’s assurance of its ability to honour its
    debt obligations relating to 1MDB is itself a strong signal to the financial markets. In this instance, the
    government has reiterated that it has ample funds to fulfil the debt obligations of the debt-laden state
    strategic investment fund.</p>

**Workable Solutions</h3>**

<p>Aside from the debt-related issues pertinent to 1MDB, the government also needs to remain steadfast in
    convincing investors on the effectiveness of its “home-grown” remedy to boost the country’s ailing finances
    or to build a sustainable economy moving forward. One ideal example is how revenue losses from
    replacing the goods and services tax (GST) with sales and service tax (SST) – which have come under the
    scrutiny of international rating agencies – can be cushioned by the anticipated rise in oil revenue for 2018
    and a cut in government expenditure (by plugging various wastages and leakages as well as by raging war
    against corrupt practices).
    </p>

<p>Moreover, the finance ministry has further assured that not only is the fiscal reform initiative already
    underway, the GST shortfall can be offset by revenue and expenditure measures that will be announced in
    due course. The same applies to the re-evaluation of mega projects approved by the previous
    administration whereby a renegotiation on the terms may be imminent (Bandar Malaysia, Tun Razak
    Exchange, Pan Borneo Highway and the RM55 bil East Coast Rail Link or ECRL) while some will be
    scrapped entirely (the RM110 bil High-Speed Rail connecting Singapore with Kuala Lumpur and the RM40
    bil Klang Valley Mass Rapid Transit Line 3).
    </p>

<p>On a similar note, the government has
    redefined the meaning of foreign direct
    investments and technology transfers from
    abroad while maintaining it does not oppose
    investments from China, the world’s secondbiggest economy. Pointing specifically to the
    ECRL, economist Prof Jomo Kwame
    Sundaram who is part of the five-member
    Council of Eminent Persons has justified that
    the project was not an investment from China,
    but a huge loan from China’s export-import
    bank for</p>

<p>One final observation is that listed companies
    which were badly affected in the recent selloff are those which are perceived to be cronies of the previous
    administration and those that are heavily dependent on government contracts. This perhaps serves as a
    clarion call to founders and head honchos of listed companies that business and politics don’t mix; their
    indulgence in political gamble can come at a high price with dire consequences to the value of their stocks.</p>

<p>It is indeed a great pity that politically-affliated stocks are subject to dumping in view of the changing
    political tide regardless of their promising business prospects. Thankfully, the sky in the days ahead is
    unlikely to remain gloomy. Over the medium- to long-term, as business confidence improves with
    adjustment to the new management style of the government of the day, there should be clearer skies for
    the capital markets. </p>
