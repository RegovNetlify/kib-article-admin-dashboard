  DOES the thought of retirement cause anxiety or the exact opposite –
  indifference? While the idea of
      preparing for retirement may be intimidating to some, younger folk may think of it as such a faraway
      concept that is too early to plan for. Whatever the case may be, retirement planning can be simple and
      straightforward. It does not even require you to give up all the day-to-day luxuries you are currently
      enjoying. All it takes is a little bit of discipline. There is a growing concern regarding the ageing population
      in Malaysia. According to the Department of Statistics Malaysia, the country’s percentage of elderly
      population is expected to exceed 7% by 2020. This could cause already burgeoning medical costs to
      increase drastically within the next five years. Longer average life expectancy also means more years
      spent in retirement, which means you will need even more funds to help get you through the coming years.

<p>DOES the thought of retirement cause anxiety or the exact opposite – indifference? While the idea of
    preparing for retirement may be intimidating to some, younger folk may think of it as such a faraway
    concept that is too early to plan for. Whatever the case may be, retirement planning can be simple and
    straightforward. It does not even require you to give up all the day-to-day luxuries you are currently
    enjoying. All it takes is a little bit of discipline. There is a growing concern regarding the ageing population
    in Malaysia. According to the Department of Statistics Malaysia, the country’s percentage of elderly
    population is expected to exceed 7% by 2020. This could cause already burgeoning medical costs to
    increase drastically within the next five years. Longer average life expectancy also means more years
    spent in retirement, which means you will need even more funds to help get you through the coming years. </p>

<p>While Employees Provident Fund (EPF) has managed to provide impressive dividends year after year, it is
    too risky to depend on it as your only source of retirement income. Many people are not even actively
    contributing to their EPF. The EPF Board’s 2017 annual report showed only 7,110,517 out of 13,790,216 members were active. Most of us rely on our EPF savings for major purchases such as property or our
    children’s education. By the time you are ready to use this pool for your retirement; it might be partially
    used or almost finished.</p>

**Retirement Phases** 
</h3>

<p>The retirement age can be categorised into three phases. The first is the Go-Go Phase (50s and 60s). This
    may be the best part of retirement, where retirees live a fairly active lifestyle that includes travelling,
    hobbies and socialising. Work may still occur but on a part-time or consulting basis. This may also be the
    most expensive phase of retirement. If you are still earning an income in this phase, it can be used to offset
    some of the additional expenses that come from your new retirement lifestyle.</p>

<p>The next phase is the Slow-Go Phase (70s), where you still enjoy spending time with family and friends but
    may also be dealing with health issues. Your daily routine may now include medical appointments while
    physical limitations prohibit you from carrying out strenuous activities. The third and final phase is the NoGo Phase (80s and 90s). This phase involves less energy, less physical mobility and more rest. You will
    most probably cut back on a lot of your recreational activities while healthcare expenditure increases. Bear
    in mind that medical costs are one of the biggest drivers of inflation in retirement.</p>

**The “P” Word</h3>**

<p>Planning is the best thing you can do for your retirement years. This applies to everyone,
    whether you are just starting out in the workforce, at the peak of your career or have
    achieved your career aspirations. Calculate your retirement planning goals, commit to
    a regular savings schedule and keep to it. Always aim for a larger sum rather than
    underestimate what you would require. If you are already living your retirement
    years, planning is still needed to ensure that you do not spend beyond your
    means.</p>

<p>Planning habits correspond to a person’s age. For example, an investor in his
    early 20s should prioritise paying off his credit card debt and student loans and
    establishing an emergency fund. He should also start setting aside funds for his
    retirement savings. In his 30s and 40s, he needs to reassess his insurance
    needs, alleviate bigger debts such mortgage and car loans, and increase his
    retirement savings. In his 50s, it is time to reduce expenses, boost his retirement
    savings aggressively and evaluate his retirement plan to ensure that it is still
    aligned with his goals. However, as every person is different, it is important to
    have a plan that fits your individual needs, goals and circumstances. </p>

**When Enough Is Enough </h3>**

<p>How do you know if you are saving enough? A rule of thumb is to set aside about
    one-third (33%) of your salary for retirement. Your EPF contribution should make up about 23% while the
    remaining 10% can be in the form of investments. A few minor inconveniences today can turn into gains
    that compound over time. For example, that artisanal coffee that you have been buying daily for 30 years, if
    saved at a 10% annual interest rate, will compound to an astonishing RM600,000 for your retirement.
    We’re not saying you should swear off coffee altogether, but maybe bring the frequency down to a couple
    of times a week instead of every day. What about how much you will need to maintain your current lifestyle
    during retirement?</p>

<p>Another rule of thumb (good thing we have two) is to aim for a minimum of two-thirds (67%) of your last
    drawn salary as income in retirement. Do remember that retirees often spend more on travel, entertainment
    and dining out since they have the time to do so.</p>

**Diversification</h3>**

<p>Now that we have established that retirement planning does not need to be intimidating, it is time to look at
    how you can supplement your retirement funds with other things besides saving. Many people choose to
    invest their money to protect themselves against the
    decrease in purchasing power brought about by inflation.
    One of the key things that financial experts advocate is the
    diversification of investments.</p>

<h2>“Planning habits correspond to a
    person’s age. For example, an
    investor in his early 20s should
    prioritise paying off his credit card
    debt and student loans and
    establishing an emergency fund.
    He should also start setting aside
    funds for his retirement savings.”</h2>

<p>By diversifying, you decrease the chances of all your
    investments experiencing the same negative market forces
    at the same time. One way to do this is to blend a variety of
    investments with different characteristics so you can reduce
    their overall risk. Below is a breakdown of investment
    products that you can consider.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Equities – These are ordinary shares of companies
        that are listed on the stock exchange. They are considered high-risk investments as they fluctuate
        according to market sentiments.</li>
    <li>Unit trusts – Unit trusts are professionally managed pools of funds that are broken down into units
        for sale to investors. This gives investors an indirect involvement in a range of investments such as
        equities, bonds and fixed-income securities. They are safer than equities but still depend on market
        forces.</li>
    <li>Private retirement schemes (PRS) – Similar to unit trusts, PRS are a professionally managed
        pool of funds, except that they are dedicated to retirement only. Besides lower fees and charges
        involved, there are usually tax reliefs and incentives for those aged between 20 and 30.</li>
    <li>Investment-linked insurance – This gives the investor the benefits of protection and investment
        under a single integrated plan. Like unit trusts, investors can make capital gains as well as
        dividends. It is safer than equities but still subject to market forces.</li>
    <li>Real property – Excluding the current home of the investor, this refers to other condominiums,
        houses, flats, land or factories that belong to the investor. Profitability will depend on the type,
        location and market timing but it is one of the least liquid investments to hold. It is safer compared
        to equities, but its value can severely erode during negative times.</li>
    <li>ixed-income securities – These refer to fixed-deposit accounts, bonds and other debt
        instruments with fixed interest payments. Bank deposit rates vary according to time and the
        respective financial institutions, while bonds generally give higher returns than bank deposits. Bank
        deposits are one of the safest investment products while bonds will depend on the issuing
        institution. The secret to long-term retirement planning is to start budgeting, saving and investing
        wisely early on in life. Decisions made in your 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s can impact your golden years.</li>
    
    </ul>
