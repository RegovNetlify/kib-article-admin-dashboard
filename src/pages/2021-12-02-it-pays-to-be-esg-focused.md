There is a rising tendency among asset managers in recent times to retool their
    existing funds by giving those products a sustainability focus. Over the past two
    years, conventional asset managers in the US have repurposed some 25 existing
    funds by incorporating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria into
    their investment process.

<p>Putnam Investments which recently reclassified its US$4.3 bil MultiCap
    Growth and US$450 mil MultiCap Value funds to becoming Putnam
    Sustainable Leaders and Putnam Sustainable Future respectively hopes its
    new sustainability approaches will improve net flows by attracting a new
    investor base. Looking at a bigger picture, even Norway, which is reputed to
    be a major oil-producing country, has managed to strike a balance between meeting high
    standards of ESG objectives and a steady investment return. Norway first issued
    guidelines for the observation and exclusion of companies from the Government Pension
    Fund Global in November 2004.</p>

<p>The guidelines include two types of criteria, one that was related to specific product types
    and excluded companies that produced tobacco, sold or produced weapons or military
    materials to certain countries, or produced weapons that violated fundamental
    humanitarian principles. A separate set of criteria excluded companies where there was
    an unacceptable risk of grossly unethical corporate conduct that contributes to serious or
    systematic human rights violations, serious violations of the rights of individuals in
    situations of war or conflict, severe environmental damage, gross corruption or other
    serious violations of fundamental ethical norms.</p>

**Gaining Traction</h3>**

<p>Such ESG investing trends are likely to catch up in emerging economies. There is
    growing evidence to suggest that ESG factors – when integrated into investment analysis
    and portfolio construction – may offer investors potential long-term performance
    advantages.</p>

<p>Very much associated with ESG is socially responsible investing (SRI) which goes one
    step further by actively eliminating or selecting investments according to specific ethical
    guidelines. The underlying motive could be religion, personal values or political beliefs.
    Last December, the Securities Commission unveiled the SRI Funds Guidelines that apply
    to fund products within its oversight such as unit trust funds, real estate investment trust
    funds, exchange-traded funds, and venture capital and private equity funds. The
    guidelines also introduce additional disclosure and reporting requirements that aim to
    encourage greater transparency in investment policies and strategies of SRI funds.</p>

<p>Fund managers of qualified SRI funds under these guidelines will be eligible for tax
    incentives as announced in the 2018 Budget. With Islamic funds being recognised as part of the SRI universe, Malaysia is currently the largest SRI funds market in Asia exJapan. It has 30% share of the region’s US$52 bil fund assets.
</p>

<p>Additionally, Malaysia is also the second largest Islamic funds market globally (by
    domicile) at 29% of the US$56 bil global total asset under management (AUM).
    According to the Green Finance Opportunities in Asean report published by DBS Bank
    and the UN Environment Programme Inquiry in November 2017, demand for additional
    Asean green investments – a facet of ESG – is envisaged to estimate US$3 tril between
    2016 and 2030 with 60% earmarked for infrastructure. </p>

<p>This opportunity spells a new Asean green investment market that was 37 times the size
    of the global green bond market in 2016. In this regard, Malaysia’s well established bond
    and sukuk markets are in a good position to gain from the anticipated green growth given
    that infrastructure represents a significant portion of the Malaysian market.

<p>Zooming into the equity market, the FTSE4Good Bursa Malaysia Index (or ESG index)
    boasts 44 constituents (originally 24 when the index was introduced in December 2014)
    from the top 200 Malaysian stocks in the FTSE Bursa Malaysia EMAS Index as of endFebruary. Designed to measure the performance of companies demonstrating strong
    ESG practices, the index excludes companies which manufacture tobacco; weapons
    systems, and components for controversial weapons (ranging from cluster munitions,
    anti-personnel mines, depleted uranium and chemical/biological weapons to nuclear
    weapons)</p>

<h3>Rapid Growth</h3>

<p>Given that it has fast become a norm for investors to evaluate ESG factors alongside
    financial data when determining their investments, sceptics should feel encouraged by
    the outcome of a recent study by global investment research outfit Morningstar into the
    performance of its Sustainability Index Family. Of its 20 indices, 16 have outperformed
    their non-sustainable counterparts over their life span.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Asia-focused Sustainability indices – Asia, Asia ex-Japan and Asia-Pacific
    which includes Australia, Asia-Pacific ex-Japan and broad Emerging Markets – all beat
    their mainstream counterparts. Further debunking the myth is having the investment
    landscape rewritten of late with all the players in the investment value chain shifting their
    focus to long-term, sustainable, risk-adjusted returns as observed by BNP Paribas
    Securities Services head of investment analytics and sustainability (Asia-Pacific) Madhu
    Gayer.
    </p>

**Largest Markets</h3>**

<p>This is a key global trend with worldwide responsible investment assets standing at
    nearly US$23 tril as of end-2016, according to the 2016 Global Sustainable Investment
    Review. In Asia ex-Japan, US$52.1 bil in assets were managed during the period using
    one or more sustainable investment strategies. When Shariah compliant funds are
    excluded, the sustainable investment assets total US$34.2 bil. Sustainable investment
    assets have grown 16% between 2014 and 2016 compared with 32% from 2012 to 2014</p>

<p>The largest markets for sustainable investing in Asia ex-Japan are Malaysia (30%), Hong
    Kong (26%), South Korea (14%) and China (14%) while China emerged the fastest
    growing market for sustainable investing at 105% since the start of 2014, followed by India (104%) and Pakistan (50%). Aside from the promising statistics, current investing
    trends seem to point in the direction that sustainable investing could be a way to reach
    new demographics of investors while addressing changing investor preferences. Studies
    show that women and younger investors care most about sustainability. As these
    demographic segments gain greater control of wealth, demand for ESG-minded
    investments is likely to grow.  </p>
