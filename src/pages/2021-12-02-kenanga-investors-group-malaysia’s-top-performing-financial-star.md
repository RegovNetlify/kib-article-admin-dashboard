<p>SO WHEN HE ANNOUNCED earlier this year that he had chosen Kuala Lumpur as the
    location for his multibillion-dollar regional distribution hub, it was quite rightly seen as a
    ringing endorsement for Malaysia’s bid to establish itself as one of ASEAN’s major
    logistics centres and investment gateways.</p>

<p>Home to more than 622 million people and with a combined GDP of close to US$3
    trillion, ASEAN is increasingly an economic force to be reckoned with, while Malaysia is
    rapidly emerging as one of its most attractive destinations for inward investment.
    According to the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report for 2016-17, it
    has the fourth-least-burdensome regulatory environment in Asia as well as one of the
    region’s most well-developed financial infrastructures.</p>

<p>And one of the brightest stars of the Malaysian financial sector is Kenanga Investors
    Berhad (KIB), which over the past five years has developed into one of the country’s top
    investment and asset management houses to watch in terms of innovation,
    progressiveness, and consistent investment returns. This has all happened under the
    careful stewardship of its chief executive officer, Ismitz Matthew De Alwis, who was
    awarded 2018 Malaysia CEO of the Year by the Best of the Best Awards, for the second
    consecutive year, hosted by Asia Asset Management.</p>

<p>KIB is currently on something of a roll. It had snapped up several key industry awards
    lately, with the most recent being named as Investors’ Choice—Fund House of the Year
    2017, voted in by investors through Fundsupermart.com. This further complements KIB’s
    earlier prestigious recognition as 2018 Malaysia’s Best Pension Fund Manager and Best
    Islamic Equity Group by Asia Asset Management and The Edge Thomson Reuters,
    respectively. KIB’s funds have also won many accolades over the years and are widely
    recognized as being among the consistently top-performing in the country.
    Such is its reach and reputation that there is rarely a major regional or local awards
    ceremony hosted by the international financial sector’s media where one of KIB’s
    products is not recognized or rewarded. De Alwis attributes both his own and KIB’s success to a healthy combination of a rock-solid performance record and a steadfast
    commitment to innovation, a philosophy embraced by everyone in the organization. This
    belief and conviction in progress is also evidenced across the board; its parent company
    Kenanga Investment Bank Berhad, for example, recently joined forces with Japan’s
    Rakuten Securities to launch the first-ever Malaysian full online trading system complete
    with straight-through processing to Bursa Malaysia. </p>

<p>Since its acquisition of 100% interest in ING Investment Management’s local unit back in
    2013, it now controls four subsidiaries: Kenanga Islamic Investors, Kenanga Funds, and
    two other nominee companies. Between them, they offer a wide range of products and
    services, including fund management for unit trusts and private retirement schemes
    (PRS), investment advisory, collective investment schemes, portfolio management
    services, and private wealth services, as well as segregated private mandates and
    alternative investments for retail, corporate, and institutional clients.</p>

<p>On the acquisition, De Alwis explains, it was part of a concerted effort on behalf of the
    bank to diversify its asset management services. “Historically, we were predominantly
    known as an institutional player that managed pension funds, Malaysian GLCs, and large
    corporate clients,” he says.</p>

*“We Have Now Diversified Our Strategies To Include Mass Retail
    Markets Through Multi-distribution Channels."</h2>*

<p>Moving ahead, we plan to further grow our clientele in the mass affluent to high-net-worth
    segment market.” To this end, KIB is now on a mission to cater for Malaysia’s
    professional classes in addition to its well-stocked pool of high-net-worth individuals
    (HNWI), who, De Alwis reasons, already have the millions or so required to set up a
    private wealth account to handle their investment affairs. Consequently, Kenanga is now
    also turning its attention to the ever-growing pool of working professionals who are
    starting out with savings of between US$50,000 and US$100,000 and who are equally in
    need of the advice that KIB’s network of financial consultants (licensed individuals who
    are authorized to market and distribute unit trusts and/or PRS) are ready to provide.</p>

<p>To help this network give Kenanga’s new customer base the most appropriate and up-todate advice, KIB offers to its clients KenWealth, a customer relationship and portfolio
    management platform that provides clients with access to over 20 well-established
    product partners within the industry. Instead of the run-of-the-mill products that are
    usually heaped onto a client, KenWealth first assesses clients’ profiles, their financial
    statuses, and their risk tolerance levels before selecting the most suitable products that
    will then make up their entire portfolio—from investment protection that is made up of
    both life and general insurance, to treasury deposits and wills and trusts.</p>

<p>Any online tool is, of course, only as good as the information, data, and analysis that it
    has been set up to harness, as De Alwis is only too aware. He also knows that most of
    KIB’s clients are not necessarily looking for spectacular—and therefore, by definition,
    high-risk—returns on their capital. “We are at a point in the cycle where we have a new
    generation of financially educated investors who are not looking for superstar funds or
    one-day wonders,” he explains. “They just want consistency, which is why we ensure that
    our funds have steady three-, five-, and 10-year records.” Performing investment vehicles
    coupled with customization and flexibility factors only add on to how seriously KIB intends
    to develop this sophisticated group of clients even further. In 2013, to meet this demand
    for a reliable return on investment, KIB launched its first absolute return fund. Like other
    such funds, the Kenanga Asia Pacific Total Return Fund was designed to produce a
    positive return regardless of prevailing market conditions, and it has so far done exactly
    what it set out to do. With 40% of its equity allocation in Hong Kong and a further 10%
    each in Taiwan and South Korea, the fund delivers a compound return of 10% per year.</p>

<p>A product of Malaysia’s rapid growth over the past 25 years, the emergence of an
    affluent middle class is not the only socioeconomic development that De Alwis and his
    colleagues at KIB are in the process of addressing. In recent months, a tongue-in-cheek
    scarf TV advertisement showing a young woman applying shampoo to her hijab went
    viral when posted on YouTube. While it provoked some anger but also a great deal of
    humorous appreciation for the parody that it was intended to be, it can also be seen as
    emblematic of the growing purchasing power of the nation’s Muslim population. And in a
    country where more than 60% of the inhabitants—around 20 million people—are
    adherents of Islam, financial institutions such as KIB are making ever-greater attempts to
    meet that market’s requirements by developing Islamic banking products and services.</p>

<p>Malaysia’s Islamic finance industry has, in fact, been in existence for well over 30 years,
    ever since the Islamic Banking Act of 1983 paved the way for the country’s first Islamic
    bank. Malaysia’s total Islamic banking assets currently stand at around US$65.6 billion
    and regularly record an annual growth rate of 18%-20%. And, along with a number of fullfledged Islamic banks, many of these assets are managed by the Islamic subsidiaries of
    conventional financial institutions, including KIB’s Kenanga Islamic Investors Berhad
    (KIIB) arm.</p>

*According To The Precepts Laid Down In Shariah Law, Islamic
    Financial Products Must Be Based On The Concept Of Mutual
    Risk And Profit-sharing Between The Parties.</h2>*

<p>Interest (riba), gambling (maisir), and speculative trading (gharar) are prohibited, shifting
    the emphasis onto leasing (ijarah), profit-sharing (mudharabah), and partnerships
    (musvarakah).</p>

<p>“Our Islamic products are now focused on equities and fixed-income funds, and we
    believe there will be further growth in this area,” De Alwis predicts. “There is a global
    Islamic wealth pool of around US$11 trillion to $12 trillion that could be unlocked in the
    years ahead.” All of KIB’s Islamic financing, treasury, and stockbroking products are
    subject to scrutiny by its own Shariah Committee, which brings together four experts in
    Shariah law whose role it is to ensure full compliance to the principles of Islam. Local
    regulatory bodies have been spearheading the growth of this segment not only locally but
    also globally.</p>

<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) recently
    launched the Islamic Fund and Wealth Management
    Blueprint to strengthen Malaysia’s competitive
    position in the global Islamic financial sector. His
    reference to the global nature of the Islamic wealth
    pool is telling, for it points to the growing
    international nature of KIB’s ambitions:</p>

<p>“Our current strategy and strength is primarily for the
    Malaysian-centric market, but we do have a growing
    clientele across ASEAN. In practical terms,
    companies in the same time zone as their investors
    have a competitive advantage. From here, we can
    easily work with clients in Singapore, Japan, China,
    and Hong Kong. Even companies in Kazakhstan,
    which might have traditionally considered London or
    Dubai as their natural choice for a financial hub, may
    in the future consider Malaysia, as we are both
    geographically and culturally closer, apart from leveraging on Malaysia’s existing
    infrastructure and capabilities in Islamic finance.”</p>

<p>De Alwis knows the company’s limitations as well as its strengths, however, and has
    decided to set up strategic alliances in the countries where it is looking to expand its
    client base. “In today’s volatile and highly specialized markets, it is a much more efficient
    way for us to work with local companies than to set up offices abroad,” he explains, “and
    it has delivered much better results for us.”</p>

<p>As well as KIB’s track record and reputation, the international investment community is
    being increasingly drawn to work with Kenanga because of Malaysia’s growing potential as a point of access for ASEAN. When Ma proposed setting up a Digital Free Trade Zone
    for his e-commerce operation last year, he was amazed that it only took four months to
    push the legislation through.</p>

<p>Malaysia offers investors a dynamic and vibrant business environment with the ideal
    prerequisites for growth and profits.</p>

**The Country Is Supported By A Market-oriented Economy And
    Pro-business Government Policies.</h2>**

<p>The government continues to attract investors by ensuring well-developed infrastructure
    (i.e., a network of well-maintained highways and railways; well-equipped seaports and
    airports; high-quality telecommunications network and services; fully developed industrial
    parks \[including free industrial zones], technology parks, the Multimedia Super Corridor
    (MSC), and Advanced MSC Malaysia Cybercities and Cybercentres).</p>

<p>With liberal investment policies through a well-developed legal system (British) and the
    continuous support and facilitation from the government, internationally renowned brands
    have chosen Malaysia as their regional hub. Companies like BMW, Daimler Chrysler,
    Dell, GE, Honeywell, IKEA, Sony, Samsung, and many more have been able to establish
    a strong base that will continue to serve as a pivot of growth, both locally and regionally
    for them. The government also continues to promote a vibrant and progressive capital
    market, which is among the best in the Asia-Pacific region and ASEAN. But it is not just
    the high-quality and well-regulated capital market or the growing affluence of the middle
    classes that is attracting investors. The establishment of the International Organisation of
    Securities Commissions’ (IOSCO) Asia-Pacific hub in the Malaysia regional hub was also
    a further reflection of Malaysia’s commitment in promoting greater cross-border
    regulatory collaboration and cooperation. This is aligned with KIB’s aspirations under
    ASEAN in promoting greater regional connectivity. Kenanga Investors is ready to help
    pave the way and be the preferred choice of investors as the gateway into Malaysia and
    the region.</p>
