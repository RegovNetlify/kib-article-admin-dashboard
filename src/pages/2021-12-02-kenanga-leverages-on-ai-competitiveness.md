<p>Investment managers in the country are exploring or looking to incorporate innovations in
    their daily operations as it provides a better platform and the ability to compete within the
    market space.</p>

<p>While noting that such technologies will automate tasks to improve efficiency and
    accuracy, Kenanga Investors Bhd (KIB) chief executive officer Ismitz Matthew De Alwis
    said it can also help investment managers to respond in a more relevant and proactive
    manner to face black swan events.</p>

<p>"Innovation in our age has also revolutionised the way we
    do our business, especially in the financial industry. We
    have no choice but to keep abreast of changes so that we
    don’t get left behind,” he responded to NST Business via
    an email reply recently.
    </p>

<p>Ismitz said technology in general, has made the financial
    industry progress in terms of efficiency, convenience, and
    security, among other aspects.</p>

<p>The Kenanga Global Multi-Asset Fund (KGMAF), the firstof-its-kind in Malaysia, uses proprietary artificial
    intelligence (AI) techniques to monitor markets 24-hour,
    identifying patterns in global market prices and volumes.</p>

<p>"As opposed to other AI techniques, KGMAF is looking for
    any general patterns, and is not making assumptions that
    markets mean-revert or follow trends.</p>

<p>“This is only possible due to recent advancements in AI that allow systems to more
    efficiently process very large data sets and make better probabilistic forecasts,” he said.</p>

<p>KGMAF is a fully systematic programme that allows decisions by the system without
    human intervention with constant hands-on experts to monitor the system behaviour in
    the event that it behaves unexpectedly.
    </p>

<p>Ismitz pointed out that KGMAF’s system is able to scan 24 hours daily on large global
    market data sets, and take advantage of the best risk-adjusted opportunities.</p>

<p>“What KGMAF is trying to do is pick up on intraday price movements, which allows it to
    perform irrespective of the movement of the underlying markets," he said.</p>

<p>While all investments have risk and can go up and down, including KGMAF, Ismitz
    believed KGMAF has significantly lower risk due to its strategy that has performed well
    when volatility increases.</p>

<p>He also cited KGMAF’s ability to find high risk-reward opportunities in large data sets,
    and execute the best opportunities in real-time.
    </p>

<p>KIB’s immediate plans for the future revolve around the improvement of client experience
    through the adoption of financial technology with the commitment of channelling
    resources and research and development (R&D) into new products.</p>

<p>"We strive to be able to cater to evolving customer expectations and increased trust and
    transparency with our clients. We look forward to providing clients with a seamless
    product application process and easy online portfolio management of their investments,”
    he added.</p>
