<p>WHILE Malaysia’s unit trust industry is not insulated from the volatility swings experienced in the equity
    and bond markets in recent times, prospects of a rebound look good. This is given that various reform
    policies to generate a return of monetary and human capital are underway to drive back capital flows over
    the longer term.</p>

<p>Moreover, concerns over regulatory uncertainty and kitchen-sinking exercises by the new government are
    expected to ease as it consolidates its fiscal position alongside efforts to restore investor confidence,
    according to Affin Hwang Asset Management Bhd chief marketing & distribution officer Chan Ai Mei.
    However, some market softness can be expected in the near term as the government’s immediate focus is
    to implement structural and institutional reforms to curb corruption, as well as enhancing governance and
    transparency. “Nonetheless, a robust governance framework will eventually lead to business stability that
    would attract more sustainable forms of foreign direct investment,” Chan tells FocusM.</p>

<p>Coupled with fresh pro-growth policies, this would provide the uplift of growth for the economy and increase
    wealth distribution. Manulife Asset Management Services Bhd CEO Jason SM Chong attributes the market
    sell down over the past one month to foreign fund outflows. “We believe they will likely return when
    investors are convinced that major hidden skeletons have surfaced while the government continues to
    provide a clearer roadmap on its plans to drive the economy going forward. The longer-term fundamentals
    remain positive for Malaysia, especially with the new government looking to weed out corruption and
    excessive spending,” he opines. In the meantime, Chong expects local pension funds and insurance companies with large monthly inflows to continue investing in the local market. “Given the current market
    uncertainties, we would advocate
    ‘dollar cost averaging, which is to
    either average up or down your
    investment cost,” he advises. </p>

<p>“History has shown that investors
    tend to enjoy better returns in the
    medium to long term by doing
    dollar cost averaging rather than
    trying to time the markets.” </p>

**Growth Catalysts</h3>**

<p>Kenanga Investors Bhd chief
    investment officer Lee Sook Yee
    foresees banks benefiting from a
    gradual rising interest rate
    environment and higher consumer
    spending from the removal of the
    Goods and Services Tax. There
    are also prospects of stronger
    corporate earnings growth for the
    next one to two years, underpinned
    by solid gross domestic product
    and private consumption growth.</p>

<p>“Finally, the roll-out of a
    comprehensive fiscal plan to
    address fiscal consolidation could
    be a rerating catalyst to the market
    and currency in the medium to
    long-term,” Lee tells FocusM.</p>

<p>These are the key investment themes that we will be watching and intend to leverage on in the future.”
    Externally, Lee expects the faster-than-expected US interest rate hikes, political turmoil in Italy which may
    threaten stability in the European Union, and US-China trade tensions to continue clouding the global
    economy and financial markets.</p>

<p>“During periods of high uncertainty, we may adopt more defensive investment strategies, which may
    include keeping higher cash levels or switching to defensive sectors such as consumer and healthcare,”
    she shares. </p>

<p>On events that could detract or boost fund performance, Lee expects renewed ringgit weakness to benefit
    exporter holdings while a potential delay of infrastructure projects is negative to construction holdings.
    “That said, we think construction stocks have been oversold as some infrastructure projects are likely to
    proceed, scaled down or rescheduled versus market expectation of outright cancellation,” she says. “This is
    also healthy to the construction sector and ensures more sustainable growth going forward.” </p>

**Industry Challenges</h3>**

<p>Addressing the thorny issue of cost/fees which has hindered investor appetite for unit trusts, Affin Hwang
    AM’s Chan says the natural forces of a free market would eventually drive down fees in the industry.
    “Imposing a cap on fees has been explored, however, industry players still feel that they should be given
    the flexibility to implement different kinds of strategy on distribution,” she observes.</p>

<p>There has been a greater emphasis on a performance-based fee structure in the unit trust industry where
    asset managers only receive a fee when the fund outperforms a set hurdle rate or high water-mark in the
    fund. This would be beneficial to both the asset manager and investor as it aligns their interests in the
    sense that managers are motivated to outperform while investors get a return that is higher than the
    market’s. </p>

<p>Such fee rationalisation obviously sounds more appealing than the blanket fee slashing which has become
    a common practice in developed markets (such as the US), where asset managers often have to lower
    their fees to sustain their business. In fact, technology can be an enabler to drive down costs in the
    industry.</p>

<p>Asset managers have
    become more cost-conscious
    and are looking at their entire
    value chain to see which
    processes can be automated
    or streamlined.</p>

<p>“This includes the client on
    boarding process where new
    clients can conduct their own
    risk assessment or portfolio
    suitability test,” Chan points
    ou</p>

<p>Moreover, technology is also
    an ideal platform to reach out
    to millennial investors who
    tend to be always
    online/connected, sociallyconscious, but also often
    fickle and price-sensitive. </p>

<p>“If industry players fail to
    catch up with this trend, they
    could be limiting themselves
    to the same subset of
    investors instead of drawing
    in a new group of investors who desire more convenience and automation, as well as closer proximity and
    engagement with their asset manager,” she adds. </p>

**Investment Strategies</h3>**

<p>Commenting on the strategy to apply in the current lacklustre market, Kenanga’s Lee stresses adhering to
    a bottom-up stock picking strategy which focuses on undervalued stocks whose fundamentals are deemed
    superior and sustainable. “These stocks are not the typical ‘index stocks’ … we prefer to keep close to the
    ground by interviewing corporate management and have a thorough understanding of the business model,
    management quality, certainty of earnings growth and the potential risks of the companies we invest in,”
    she says</p>

<p>“We do not change our strategies each year as this is simply illogical; as unexpected incidents or
    geopolitical events happen pretty frequently, we can rely on this consistency to help us ride the market
    highs and to weather the lows.” Manulife’s Chong sees market weaknesses as opportunities. “Investors
    should buy low and sell high and not buy high (when the market has already rebounded) and hope to sell
    higher,” he advises</p>
