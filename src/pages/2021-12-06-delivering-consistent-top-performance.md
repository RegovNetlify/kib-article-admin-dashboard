<h2>Kenanga Investors Berhad Continues To Excel With Both Their
    Flagship Funds Consistently Winning Awards Year After Year.</h2>

<p>The year 2015 was a rewarding one for Kenanga Investors Berhad (Kenanga) despite the
    challenges experienced in both the local and global markets. In addition to Fundsupermart
    Awards, the Kenanga Growth Fund was recognised as the Best Performing Equity Malaysia Fund
    for the 5 and 10 years categories at the Edge Lipper Awards 2015. Kenanga Investors received
    the Asia Asset Management’s Best of the Best Awards 2015 “Malaysia Rising Star” award, while
    Chief Investment Officer Miss Lee Sook Yee received the “CIO of the Year” award.</p>

<p>According to Kenanga’s Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer Ismitz Matthew De Alwis,
    the consistently strong performances and resilience of their two flagship funds can be attributed
    to Kenanga’s long-term investment strategy of rigorous stock-picking and its tactical asset
    allocation that identifies fundamentally attractive and possibly undervalued stocks relative to their
    peers.</p>
  
<p>“We strongly believe that having good governance with current investment risk analytics to
    monitor for consistency in investment style and setting risk returns metrics according to our
    investment philosophy and processes are also key in good fund management. We manage our
    exposures to economic and fundamental drivers of risk and return to avoid overexposure to any
    one risk factor while maximising potential upside.”</p>

<p><b>Smart Investor (SI):</b> Moving forward, what are the
    strategies in the launching of new funds (if any) in
    such a challenging and volatile market?</p>

<p><b>Ismitz Matthew De Alwis (IMDA):</b>  We will continue to
    stay focused on growing our flagship funds like KGF and
    KSGF, and increase our efforts on a few key smallersized funds such as Kenanga Growth Opportunities Fund,
    Kenanga Malaysian Inc Fund and Kenanga Premier Fund
    as they are more nimble and can be effectively deployed
    and managed. Under our suite of retirement products, we
    will be introducing the new Kenanga Shariah OnePRS
    Scheme, which consists of three Core Funds with different
    risks and return profiles to meet the Shariah-compliant
    needs of our clients – Kenanga Shariah OnePRS Growth Fund, Kenanga Shariah OnePRS
    Moderate Fund and Kenanga Shariah OnePRS Conservative Fund. We strive to ensure any new
    product we introduce to the market possesses a good degree of product differentiation and
    relevance, instead of merely producing duplications.</p>

<p><b>SI:</b> What are the main areas you feel investors should pay attention to as we venture
    deeper into 2016? </p>

<p><b>IMDA:</b> In the short-run, the unexpected outcome from Brexit could keep volatility in financial
    markets elevated. In Asia, we expect export-dependent countries like Hong Kong, Singapore and
    Malaysia to take bigger hits, potentially shedding 0.4 percentage points to one percentage point
    of growth in 2016 while GDP growth in countries like China and Indonesia are expected to
    decline by 0.2 percentage points. </p>

<p>For equity funds, the short-term volatility warrants a defensive strategy. However, in the longerterm, we expect markets to stabilise and could come back once the initial “dust settles”. Stock
    picking remains key with focus on sectors with earnings visibility and dividend support.</p>

<p>As Unit Trusts and PRS are middle to long-term investments and saving vehicles, choosing the
    right fund house with a well-constructed and well managed portfolio over time is crucial for
    investors</p>
