  2016 was indeed a challenging year for the Asian stock market, as volatility
  surged amid unexpected
      events such as Brexit and the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States. Even more
      unexpectedly, the US equity market experienced a rally – rising by 13% y-o-y – compared to Asian
      markets which was only up by 3% on average (MSCI Asia ex-Japan and ASEAN). For fund managers
      Kenanga Investors, which its strong focus on Malaysia and Asia, 2016 was nothing short of a tumultuous
      ride.

<p>However, the company triumphed despite all odds – including overcoming a renewed weakness in the
    Malaysian ringgit and keeping afloat in one of Asia’s worst-performing markets for the year – to gain three
    accolades from Asia Asset Management in the categories of Best Institutional House, CEO of the Year
    and CIO of the Year (Malaysia).</p>

    Investors both believe that the most important
    aspect of creating a robust investment
    portfolio which is able to withstand systemic
    shocks is through a strong focus on research
    and risk management. “I think what matters
    sometimes is not just outperformance in the
    up market, but also the ability to protect your
    downside in a down market. Our strong focus
    on research has actually helped us to identify
    companies with resilient earnings that outperformed the general market, and from a risk management perspective, has provided us with a
    diversified point of view and fairly liquid position to weather the downturn,” reveals Ms. Lee. She also adds
    that Kenanga Investors sees itself as a value-oriented, focussed portfolio manager with a disciplined
    approach to research and bottom-up stock picking; regardless of market conditions.</p>

**Best Institutional House </h3>**

<p>Kenanga’s “Best Institutional House” award reflects its consistent performance in the market; which Ms.
    Lee attributes to the company’s good governance policies and dedicated investment risk analytics
    modules. She adds: “The risk-return metrics are according to our investment philosophy and processes.
    We manage our stock, sector, country and any identifiable cluster exposures to avoid taking on excessive
    risk to any one risk factor, while maximising potential upside.”</p>

<p>Mr. De Alwis adds that the win would not have been possible without the dedication and hard work from
    his investment team, led by Ms. Lee. “We are very happy with the win, which encompasses the
    consistency of our performance, quality of client servicing, reporting, processing systems and operational
    efficiency.”</p>

<p>With regards to their investment outlook for 2017 in the region, Ms. Lee believes that the Malaysian equity
    market will finally see a rebound after a three-year slump, while regionally, her top picks are North Asia
    vis-à-vis ASEAN as these countries are less vulnerable to capital flight in the short-term. “Our focus for
    2017 is more on sectors rather than countries. We are positive on the tech and internet sector across
    China, South Korea and Taiwan, as new trends like flexible OLED, automated driving and virtual reality
    continue to drive demand. For the internet sector, e-commerce is still forecasted to grow at double-digit
    CAGRs, and Asia’s growing population provides tremendous opportunities in this space.”</p>

**Leadership In Tough Times</h3>**

<p>Mr. De Alwis is gracious in sharing his top tips on what it means to be a leader in today’s diverse
    workplace environment, and how to navigate tough times with his team’s unwavering support. “At
    Kenanga Investors we believe that diversity is strength. Our different experiences and cultures add value
    to the collaborative environment in which we work.”</p> 

<p>“As a leader, I always try to inculcate several habits into my working style. Chief amongst these is the
    ability to listen. Another important trait is accountability. During difficult periods, they can count on me to be there when they need guidance or to bounce ideas off when solving issues. Without a strong foundation
    for employees to rely on, they will not be convinced to remain with a company through thick and thin.</p>

<p>Reflecting on 2016, Ms. Lee shares that one of her toughest tasks was to be able to stay firm in their
    stock-picking approach. “Providing long-term sustainable investment solutions to investors is more
    important than anything else,” she concludes.</p>
