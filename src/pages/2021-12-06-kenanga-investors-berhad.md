<p>Kenanga Investors Berhad (KIB) receiving the coveted Fund House of the Year award at the
    Fundsupermart Recommended Unit Trust Award 2017 didn't come as a surprise to many. The award,
    voted in by visitors to Fundsupermart's website, is a testament to KIB's investment philosophy of providing
    consistent returns to its investors. Smart Investor had the privilege to speak to the Executive Director and
    Chief Executive Officer of KIB, Ismitz Matthew De Alwis, on the winning formula.</p>
  
Smart Investor (SI): Congratulations to KIB for winning the Fund House of the Year award. What is your winning formula?

<p><b>Ismitz Matthew (IM):</b> : Thank you very much. It is truly an honour to win the only Fundsupermart award that
    was voted in by the people. Our success is mainly attributed to the fact that we remained focused on our
    core strength, which is providing our clients with consistent returns.</p>

**SI**: What measures do you take to ensure that the fund performs to its fullest
    potential and beyond?</h3>

<p><b>IM: </b> We have a more disciplined approach towards fund management; meaning we
    don't shift our focus too often, or chase short-term gains because that's riskier. We
    are value stock pickers; therefore, we have a strong conviction in any stock that we
    pick. Conviction is very crucial to persevere in any market conditions. But that does
    not mean we don't do our homework. Our investing strategy involves bottom-up</p>

<p>stock picking backed by strong fundamental research and a thorough understanding of a company's
business model. This focus on research has helped us to identify companies with resilient earnings.
Picking a company is not just about visiting their corporate website and reading the page on investors'
relation. </p>

<p>We are tasked to go beyond that. At times, a company's P&L may look good, with steady profits and
ample cash in the bank; so, we'd think it's invest worthy. However, we may have to also look at other
factors such as the efficient deployment of cash and thorough maximisation of shareholders' returns.
These parameters will affect share prices in the long run.</p>

**SI: Tell us more about the winning funds, namely the
    Kenanga Growth Fund, Kenanga OnePRS
    Conservative Fund and Kenanga OnePRS Growth
    Fund. What are some of the distinctive benefits of
    investing in these funds?**

<p><b>IM: </b> The Kenanga Growth Fund is a Malaysian equity
    fund that focuses on investments in small to midcap
    stocks and selective big cap companies. Though the risk
    is high, it is not as high other funds that invest in solely
    small or mid-cap stocks. </p>

<p>Our Growth Fund is by far one of the most consistent
    funds in the country over all periods, be it 3, 5, or 10
    years. As at 30 June 2017, our 10- year returns stands at
    287.92%", which is nearly three times of initial
    investment, despite a global financial crisis in 2008.</p>

<p>Disregarding ringgit movement, if you plan to retire here, this is a suitable fund for you. It is open to
    anyone, especially if you do not have the time to dabble in the market or monitor your own stocks'
    performance. KGF is also ideal for millennial who wish to grow their wealth.</p>

<p>They can even withdraw from their EPF to invest in our fund, and at a minimum investment amount of just
    RM1000, it's the perfect start-off fund.</p>

<p>Our two award-winning private retirement scheme (PRS) funds are the OnePRS Conservative Fund and
    OnePRS Growth Fund. PRS funds were conceptualised mainly to encourage Malaysians to save more for
    retirement because it's a well-known fact that many Malaysians don't have sufficient money to sustain
    themselves when they retire.</p>

<p>The OnePRS Growth Fund is targeted at those below 40, and what makes it attractive is its returns. The
    fund gave 14.25%\* in returns in just one year, and 25.3%\* for a 3-year period as at 30 June 2017. This
    averages to 7.79%* per annum which is an attractive option for investors.</p>

<p>As for the OnePRS Conservative Fund, those 40 to 50 are
    our target market. For a 3-year period, the returns were at
    14.48%\* as at 30 June 2017; on an average it's 4.55%\* a
    year, which is still higher than FD rates. </p>

<p>It's slightly lower than the PRS Growth Fund as we believe
    this being an individual's conservation stage, we shouldn't
    take a high risk approach when investing. </p>

<p>I say with great pride that we have always been among the
    top performing for the PRS Growth category with exception
    to its inception year. </p>

<p>There are 8 players in the category, and to be frank, we
    were the last kid on the block. But today, we are at the top
    spot garnering numerous awards, which simply means, we
    are on the right track!</p>

    competitors. We do not want to be
    a one-hit wonder."</h2>
