<p>LIVING on the edge is often perceived as a sheer act of stupidity by people with low-risk
    appetites. But for thrill-seekers, i.e. stuntmen, rock climbers or gamblers, such lifestyles promise
    excitement and fulfilment – something that cannot be quantified by mere dollars and cents</p>
  
<p>The same logic applies to investing – at one extreme are those play-it-safe investors who are
    overly prudent or risk-averse in parting with their hard-earned money, while the other extreme
    features those who would happily throw their money around, spurred by the belief that their good
    fortune is ripening</p>

<p>Hence, it can be baffling to learn how a university professor who specialises in the subject of
    economics and finance can suddenly fall prey to scammers who operate get-rich-quick schemes.
    This surely has to do with the universal concept of greed. The Salt Lake Tribune in a recent
    editorial entitled “Gambling-averse Utahans take wild investment bets”, questioned why Utahans
    – who are always speaking up against the evils of gambling – so often fall into the pitches of con
    men who promise outrageously high returns with obvious significant risk.</p>

**Isn’t an investment that promises a return of 600% per annum (or more) a form of gambling too?</h3>**

<p>Closer to home, as of July 12 last year, Bank Negara has identified 272 companies comprising
    illegal foreign exchange trading (forex) and gold investment firms that wooed Malaysians with
    tempting prospects of becoming overnight millionaires. Obviously, the operators of these
    “unauthorised and unapproved” schemes are able to use money received from subsequent
    depositors to pay high returns or to re-pay the principal amount to the earlier depositors.</p>

<p>However, such schemes are bound to fail eventually once the pipeline of new deposits have
    slowed or are altogether exhausted, leading to their collapse. Money certainly does not grow on trees, but that does not mean that we are unable to grow our very own “money tree”. Unlike
    martial art movies, we need not be a disciple to an investment guru to master the art of investing.</p>

<p>In fact, investing is all about common sense, albeit with a little effort in researching the products,
    knowing our monetary limits, having the ability to pre-empt the various pitfalls and continuously
    expanding our learning curve. Obviously, every investor has the right to decide how he/she
    wishes to strategise his/her investment portfolio but if one is unsure which route to take, it’s best
    to avoid putting all of one’s eggs in a single basket.</p>

<p>Legendary investor Warren Buffett’s (pic)
    recommendation of dumping 90% of one’s nest egg in a
    stock index fund and 10% in short-term government
    bonds has raised many eyebrows but the Berkshire
    Hathaway tycoon has not entirely erred in his opinion.
    While dumping all of one’s savings in stocks-related Investments may not be an ideal strategy for retirees; it may be more suited for youthful and highflying investors who are capable of amassing substantial income.</p>

**Invest In Equity Funds</h3>**

<p>In other words, instead of “burning” their money incessantly through lavish lifestyles – something
    which is characteristic of the younger generation of investors – Buffett’s advice can be tweaked
    as a call to invest in equity funds which are highly volatile but promises probable high returns.
    The fine print here is that the trading of stocks based on instinct and gut feel is likely to backfire
    unless the decision is backed by ample research (i.e. positive outlook from the technical and
    fundamental analyses viewpoint)</p>

<p>On the same note, observe that Buffet proposes “a stock index fund (which he specifically
    identified as a very low-cost S&P 500 index fund)” as opposed to an individual stock, for he has
    obviously considered the risk factors in the event that the single stock fails to live up to its
    expectations. Moreover, a mutual fund which invests in securities such as stocks, bonds, money
    market instruments and similar assets boasts diversification, convenience and lower costs.</p>

<p>Watching your favourite stock nose-diving or investment value shrinking can be a traumatic
    experience. A severe and prolonged market setback can wreak havoc not only on your wealth but
    affect your family, health and happiness. Even with steely nerves, how long is one able to bear
    seeing the paper gains wiped out in the blink of an eye or profits swiftly dwindling (or translating
    into losses) as the stock portfolio begins to hit rock bottom?</p>

<p>It is during such dark hours that investors should understand the concept of capitulation (as
    opposed to capitalisation) as even the most gung-ho of investors give up the hope of a rebound
    and would willingly exit the stock market no matter how low the price is. Hence, instead of
    pursuing an extreme investing strategy, it makes better sense to embark on a less risky approach
    – probably a strategy that tallies with your age and career aspirations, income, savings, spending
    power and financial commitments, among others</p>

<p>All-in, the level of risk depends on how long you can afford to tie up your money and how much
    you can afford to lose. If the plan is to invest for 10 years or more, then you may be able to take
    relatively more risk in exchange for the possibility of higher returns over a longer period.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it’s not easy to make a precise assessment of risk. Markets are inherently
    unpredictable. Sectors that look unhealthy may start performing strongly and steadily – or
    companies that look dominant – may suddenly get blown away by the revelation of a corporate
    scandal overnight.</p>

<p>Finding the middle path in investment is as important as in life. Siddhartha Gautama (Founder of
    Buddhism) said it best, “Neither a life of self-indulgence, nor one of self-mortification can bring
    happiness. Only a middle path – avoiding these two extremes – leads to peace of mind, wisdom,
    and complete liberation from the dissatisfactions of life.”</p>
