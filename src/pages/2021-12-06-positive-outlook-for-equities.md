<p>THERE’S good news for investors. </p>
  
<p>After three years of decline, the equities market seems to have turned the corner, and there is room for
    optimism going forward. Exports have recovered, and spending on infrastructure development has risen.
    With the general election expected to be called soon, more pump-priming by the government is on the
    cards.</p>

<p>“These are all positive signs for the equity market, and hopefully, we’ll see a rebound in corporate
    earnings,” says Ismitz Matthew De Alwis, executive director and chief executive officer at Kenanga
    Investors Bhd.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, there still are hurdles to clear this year and investors are advised to
    look towards the longer term in order to ride out short-term volatility, he adds. On
    the global front, Kenanga remains positive on Asia as a pick-up in global demand
    has boosted corporate earnings</p>

<p>De Alwis points out that a strong improvement in corporate earnings driven by an
    uptick in the global semiconductor cycle; stabilising commodity prices and an
    improving outlook in China have helped to moderate any negative impact of the
    US pullout from the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement and the results of the
    recent UK elections.</p>

<p>However, he cautions that there is still a chance of a “minor pull-back on negative
    news flows” given the current volatile geopolitical landscape and elevated
    valuations. Kenanga will continue to focus on in-depth research, with portfolio
    management backed by its risk management measures, says the CEO of the
    asset manager. He points out that Kenanga’s call to be positive on Asia “has
    played out well”, with sectors such as the internet and technology outperforming
    the market.</p>

<p>He says that as short-term growth normalises, Kenanga will progressively turn
    towards “good quality stocks that offer stock specific catalysts”. On the outlook
    for Asia, De Alwis is upbeat on South Korea, given its environment of improving shareholder returns. “We see evidence of restructuring at large Korean corporates, with management
    focusing on returning cash to shareholders and improving corporate governance,” he says</p>

<p>He expects ASEAN economies, particularly Malaysia, to benefit from China’s One Belt One Road initiative.</p>

<p>The outlook in Indonesia has also turned positive, as its economic fundamentals improved and inflation
    has stabilised at around 3% to 4%, down from high single-digit levels. He notes that the rupiah remains
    stable, a recent upgrade by S&P has helped to drive inflows and “there is already some evidence of reform
    in terms of revenue collection and budget execution”.</p>

<p>On its investment strategy, De Alwis says Kenanga will continue with its “bottom-up stock selection”
    approach. “We believe that fundamental research combined with a ‘relative value approach’ investment
    style can create consistent superior risk-adjusted returns,” he explains.</p>

<p>He points out that consistent outperformance over an economic cycle of three to five years can be
    consistently replicated by applying its bottom-up stock-picking strategies</p>
  
<p>“These stocks are generally undervalued relative to their intrinsic value, or are clearly undervalued relative
    to their peers and the overall market valuation,” he says. “Therefore portfolio allocation is the by-product of
    our bottom-up stock selection.”</p>

<p>This strategy has helped Kenanga record quite impressive returns on its funds. As at the end of May 2017,
    the Kenanga Growth Fund has returned 16.4% on its investments while the Kenanga Syariah Growth
    Fund saw returns of 6.18%. De Alwis sees this as a “significant” improvement over the previous year’s
    performance. That year, the returns from these two funds were either flat or slightly negative. In the longer
    term, both funds have outperformed the market with “good absolute returns over the past five years”.</p>

<p>De Alwis reminds investors that all unit trust and private retirement scheme funds do show positive and
    negative performances over the short term periods. Hence, investors will have to be aware that unit trust
    and retirement funds are both middle-to-long-term investments and savings vehicles.</p>

<p>As such, investors have an equally important role to play in determining their own fortunes. De Alwis
    advises investors to select only those investment opportunities that are compatible with their own
    objectives and risk tolerance.</p>

<p>“Given that investing in unit trusts is also a long-term commitment, investors should not be swayed by a
    sudden movement or change in the market,” he says. “By riding out the wave, they will be able to see the
    fruits of their labour at the end of their investment horizon.”</p>

<p>On its part, Kenanga will continue to prioritise the meeting of their clients’ investment objectives. </p>
