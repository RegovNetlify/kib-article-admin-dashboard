KUALA LUMPUR, 12 JULY 2019 – Kenanga Investors Berhad (Kenanga Investors) walked away with three awards at the FSMOne Recommended Unit Trusts Awards 2019/2020 (“Awards”) recently. Its flagship fund Kenanga Growth Fund (“KGF”) received the “Most Outstanding Unit Trust for 10 Years” award in a special award segment this year. On top of winning the much coveted title, KGF was also recognised under the Core Equity – Malaysia category for the 10th consecutive year, while Kenanga OnePRS Conservative Fund (“KOCF”) won the Private Retirement Scheme – Conservative title.

KGF’s legacy at the Awards began in 2010 where it first won under the Core Equity – Malaysia category. Since then it has won multiple awards both regionally and internationally. As at 31 May 2019, KGF outperformed its benchmark to deliver a total return of 10.63%1 (3 years), 29.36%1 (5 years) and 357.68%1 (since launch). Its current asset under management (“AUM”) volume stands at RM1.35bn. The Fund’s assets are actively invested in a diversified portfolio of Malaysian equity and equity-related securities of companies with sustainable business models that are trading at a discount to its intrinsic value.

Ismitz Matthew De Alwis, Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer, says, “We are honoured to have KGF receive this tremendous recognition as Most Outstanding Unit Trust for 10 Years”. He attributes its success to the fund’s consistently strong performance underpinned by KIB’s research-based stock-picking capability.

“To navigate today’s volatile market; we carefully consider a client’s risk/return appetite, risk tolerance and investment time horizons. Understandably, we would have different approaches when it comes to the different asset classes; however we will always arrive at the conclusion that various market conditions calls for specific types of strategies, which we can fluidly employ to protect against down markets and take advantage of performing markets” says De Alwis.

KOCF, which was launched in 2013, delivered similarly impressive returns for mid-to-long-term investment periods; 11.70%2 (3 years), 20.84%2 (5 years) and 23.18%2 (since launch). It seeks to provide income while preserving capital by investing in a combination of fixed income and money market instruments while also possibly investing in equities

Both KGF and KOCF are managed by Chief Investment Officer, Lee Sook Yee. “We are pleased that our suite of PRS products continues to be recognised at the Awards, it spurs us on to continue delivering tangible returns for our investors as more and more Malaysians recognise the importance of the PRS and how it helps in ensuring a sustainable yet comfortable retirement,” says Lee. She agreed that moderate and conservative funds performed relatively better compared to their growth counterparts which she attributes to the bearish market conditions occurring in recent times. “Global growth is moderating but central banks are likely to remain supportive and more towards an easing cycle. Although volatility still persists on weakening data and trade-war rhetorics, overall liquidity is supportive of equities”.

The Awards is a yearly occurrence that honours the unit trusts which have made it to the Recommended Unit Trusts list. The unit trusts are evaluated based on Performance, Risk and Expense Ratio and other factors such as consistency in the fund manager’s investment approach and the stability of the management team.
