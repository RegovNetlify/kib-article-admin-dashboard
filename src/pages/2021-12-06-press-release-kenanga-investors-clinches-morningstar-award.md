KUALA LUMPUR, 1 APRIL 2019 – Kenanga Investors Berhad (Kenanga Investors) was awarded the Best Malaysia Large-Cap Equity Fund for the Kenanga Blue Chip Fund (“KBCF”) at the Morningstar Awards 2019 ceremony.

Ismitz Matthew De Alwis, Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer said “We are proud to have been recognised by Morningstar, a globally recognised investment research entity. No matter which quadrant the market currently resides in, we are committed to our philosophy of internal fundamental research which is derived from company contacts and visits, external research, databases and quantitative support”.

The award is KBCF’s inaugural win, and serves as a point of inspiration for the fund house to continue delivering for investors following the turbulence in 2018.

The portfolio of the fund is constructed using bottom-up analysis based on the level of conviction formed for individual stocks. Its aim is to achieve long-term capital growth through investments in companies that have relatively larger market capitalisation by making an assessment of what a reasonable price is for the earnings growth that those companies offer.

“This is especially crucial when there is a persistent general decline or other unexpected negative conditions, we are able to steer KBCF to adopt a more defensive attitude,” remarked De Alwis, stressing the importance of subscribing to an investment philosophy that is able to achieve consistent performances across cycles in the long-term.

The annual Morningstar Malaysia Fund Awards is designed to help investors identify the retail funds that added the most value for investors within the context of their relevant peer group in 2018 and over longer time periods. The awards methodology emphasises the one-year period but in order to obtain an award, funds must also have delivered strong three-year returns after adjusting for risk within the awards peer groups. Furthermore, they must have at least been in the top half of their respective peer groups in a minimum of two out of the three previous calendar years.
