<p>Year-to-date (YTD), this year has brought about some cheers to stock market
    participants with the FBM KLCI having firmed 7.82% to 1,770.07 points as of July 27
    (off June 15’s high of 1,795.01). After languishing for most of last year, the cumulative
    YTD foreign funds inflow into Bursa Malaysia remains above the RM10 bil mark at
    RM10.35 bil as of July 21, the highest among its Southeast Asian peers. Is it too early for market participants to rejoice, especially after enduring a year-long lacklustre performance previously?
    Amid the backdrop of a weak ringgit against the greenback – or a suppressed oil price – is the recent
    upswing sustainable? Which are the stocks that are capable to withstand the current economic climate?</p>
  

**Global Developments**
<p>Like their investors, such and many other economic and fundamental questions always linger in the minds
    of fund managers whether they manage assets linked to unit trusts, investment-linked insurance products
    or institutional clients. In fact, they need to decipher if the current stock market rebound has the potential
    to sustain over the short, medium or long term. Or, if the situation warrants the shifting of their fund
    allocation to other assets such as bonds, properties, currencies or commodities.</p>

<p>Last year was a tough cookie for fund managers to make investment calls given the prevalence of volatile
    market conditions. Stemming from foreign funds’ exit amid concerns over the 1Malaysia Development Bhd
    (1MDB) saga and the ringgit’s depreciation against the greenback, local financial markets, in general, were
    rather subdued throughout the entire year. Further aggravated by adverse global developments such as
    Brexit (Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union) and the outcome of the US presidential election,
    which saw inward-looking candidate Donald Trump emerging victorious, a defensive stance was</p>

**Bracing For Global Challenges </h3>**

<p>Elsewhere, it is inevitable for fund or asset managers to be subject to a host of global challenges:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p><b>Regulation: </b> Domestically, local fund managers must abide by the various rules and regulations drawn
        up by the Securities Commission, Bank Negara Malaysia or any other relevant regulators. For those with
        global operations, there is a need to keep tabs with dissimilarities – or even changes – between
        regulations in their home base and those in other jurisdictions that they are currently operating in.</p>
    
        <p>As regulators seek to raise professional standards, advisers are under pressure to justify or to be
            accountable for their recommendations, ie “reasons” behind their investment calls.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Price transparency: </b> Asset managers must provide attractive charging structures that suit their clients.
        As competition heats up, costs will eventually become more transparent while coming under downward
        pressure.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Client support: </b> : Managing clients’ expectations is becoming more challenging as they become more
        demanding in terms of the level of support that they expect. Hence, it is vital for fund managers to increase
        their degree of sophistication (or work harder) in terms of depth and scope of consultancy rendered.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>The rise of technology:</b> Asset managers must embrace new technologies to remain competitive,
        whether that applies to dealing and trade execution or tools for helping to gather and analyse market data
        and information. With online mobile devices gaining prominence as an ubiquitous part of doing business –
        or as an essential tool used by many people in their daily dealings – asset managers must keep pace with
        the increasing digitalisation around them, particularly when it comes to providing access to timely
        information in appropriate formats and via different mediums.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Delivering robust quality products: </b> Global asset managers are increasingly
        expected to offer robust infrastructure and products based on well-regulated
        jurisdictions, offering daily dealings as well as clean and transparent pricing – all of
        which are requirements deemed to be hygiene factors by most clients and
        distributors. This will boost the creation of higher quality products that invest in more
        mainstream asset classes. Before this can happen, fund managers will first need to
        continuously upgrade the quality of their operations.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Being a partner, not just a product provider: </b> Given that high quality investment
        products are the foundation of any fund management business, fund managers
        need to do more than just provide good funds. They should strive to deliver support
        of the highest level – from a back office level right through to frontline sales support.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Alignment of industry practices and decision-making processes: </b> : Asset managers must respond to
        the changing way advisory businesses make investment decisions. This entails more strategic approaches
        to asset allocation which is based on clients’ goals and risk appetite rather than merely picking individual
        funds at random for clients.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Maximising returns in a lower return/higher risk environment: </b> Income and capital growth are in
            relative short supply these days and asset managers need to be careful that investors’ expectations are
            not based on assumptions that runs contrary to today’s investment climate or economic cycle. Asset
            managers’ investment strategies are usually designed as long-term investments and it is incumbent on
            asset managers to work with advisers to ensure investors are aware of this and do not have unrealistic
            expectations.</p>
        </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Having a clear business strategy: </b> Fund management has become an increasingly competitive sector;
        simply having some half decent funds is not good enough. As such, a detailed business plan with a clear
        outlining of goals and strategies to achieve them is essential. This entails a thorough understanding of the
        fund manager’s target markets – segmented by distribution channels and investor type such as adviser,
        wholesale and institutional – with a matching service proposition catering to the needs of each. Such is the
        norm today as investors in the digital era have become more informed and aware about how a switch in
        market direction can impact their investments.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
