Please be informed that Kenanga Investors Berhad will be utilising electronic communication as the default mode for the issuance of all fund reports (Annual Report / Interim Report / Quarterly Report) in line with our sustainable stewardship practices.

Effective 1 July 2019, we will cease sending printed copies of the fund reports. All investors will automatically be enrolled for this mode of communication and will receive a notification letter via post containing a hyperlink of the fund report which can be downloaded at your convenience. 

Subsequently, effective 1 January 2020, the notifications of all fund reports will only be sent via text messages to your registered mobile number with Kenanga Investors Berhad.

It is important that you provide us with your latest mobile number and email address by completing the attached Change Request Form and return it to us via email at [investorservices@kenanga.com.my](mailto:investorservices@kenanga.com.my) or fax at 03 2172 3133.

Should you choose to opt out from this at any time and wish to receive printed copies of the fund reports which would be provided to you at no cost, or should you require further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact your servicing adviser,  your servicing branches or  Investor  Services at  03 2172 3123 / 03 2172 3118 or email to [investorservices@kenanga.com.my](mailto:investorservices@kenanga.com.my).

Thank you.
