<h2>Fiscal consolidation measures, institutional
    reform and strong consumer sentiment likely
    to drive market rebound in Q4 2018 despite
    short-term capital outflow and policy
    uncertainties.
    </h2>
<p>The aftermath of the 14th general election (GE14) has not been
    kind to the local equity market or the broader Malaysian capital
    markets. The consensus among market observers is that Bursa
    Malaysia is still reeling from a sharp correction period stemming
    from foreign selling, policy uncertainties and the review of
    megaprojects. Recall that investors were initially shocked by the
    revelation of gargantuan government debts (in excess of RM1
    trillion) as well as the zero-rating of goods and services tax
    (GST), which would remove a major source of the government’s
    revenue.</p>

<p>This concern was later alleviated when the Finance Ministry announced that GST would be replaced by
    sales and services tax (SST) which, when coupled with cost savings from plugging wastage (stemming
    from abuse of public funds) as well as leakage (from graft), would eventually maintain the fiscal deficit
    target at 2.8%. Moreover, the rise in global crude oil prices (currently US$70/barrel on average, up from the
    US$52/barrel figure projected under Budget 2018) would probably entail an additional RM5.4 bil in oilrelated revenue (every US$1/barrel increase equals a gain of about RM300 mil). In all frankness, attributing
    the current soft state of the local bourse solely to the unprecedented GE14 outcome in which the ‘untested’
    Pakatan Harapan coalition emerged triumphant is very much an overstatement.
    </p>

<p>This is a given as market movement is influenced by a culmination of other internal factors – not to mention
    having to absorb various external shocks – along the way. Not helping was the poor showing of first quarter
    (1Q 2018) corporate reporting results. The reports, which were made available end-May, revealed that
    35.7% of corporates missed their earnings expectations, which was the highest such figure reported in six
    quarters. Another 45% of corporates suffered downgrades in estimates following earnings disappointments.
    A few external developments further exacerbated the already bearish sentiment in Bursa Malaysia. Fresh
    from the second interest rate hike, the US Federal Reserve has projected two more hikes (previously one
    hike) in the pipeline for the remainder of 2018.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, lingering uncertainty over the US-China trade dispute and rising eurozone instability is likely to
    pressure the performance of emerging markets in the near term. The convergence of all these negatives
    dragged the FBM KLCI down to 1,740.62 points by end-May 2018 (with a year-to-date return of -3.13%).</p>

<p>What is intriguing, however, is that Malaysia is not alone enduring in market corrections. The recent
    strengthening of the greenback has put emerging markets in a tight spot as they are unable to hold their
    currency valuations in global trade. Likewise, a higher US dollar-induced domestic sell-off in bond markets
    by foreign investors has put most emerging markets under pressure. This explains why, notwithstanding
    the substantial outflow of foreign funds in recent times, the year-to-date outflow (as of 15 June) from
    Malaysia of RM4.23 bil net (US$1.06 bil) is still deemed the lowest among its ASEAN peers, namely
    Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia (Source: MIDF Research’s Weekly Fund Flow report). In a similar
    light, volatility is also evident in the Malaysian debt securities market whereby recent outflows have slashed
    share of foreign holdings to the lowest in eight years (since June 2010) to 14.2% (April: 15.2%), according
    to Kenanga Research.
    </p>

**Holistic Development**</h3>

<p>Very broadly, the domestic market is experiencing what can be regarded as the “short-term pain for longterm gain” syndrome. The revelation of negatives left from the legacies of the previous government could
    be likened to the “kitchen sinking” exercises typically adopted by corporates.</p>

<p>In practice, “kitchen sinking” refers to the provision of major negatives and impairments in a corporate’s
    earnings which usually lead to losses. Corporate which goes through a massive “kitchen sinking” exercise
    could start the next chapter on a better and healthier position. We are hopeful that after the recent outpour
    of negative news, and having undertaken various institutional reforms, the government will look into
    additional measures to stimulate the domestic economy. We believe the government will explore new
    infrastructure projects by emphasising cost efficiency, which may include a scaled-down version of the
    previously proposed Mass Rapid Transit Line 3 (MRT3) or the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail
    (HSR). Elsewhere, the government is also likely to focus on smaller development projects such as schools,
    hospitals, roads and drainage in line with the promotion of social-economic benefits to the community.
    </p>

<p>Meanwhile, private consumption is expected to remain robust with the removal of GST, which revives
    consumer buying sentiment. Following the implementation of zero-rated GST effective June 1 for a threemonth period prior to SST implementation, automotive companies are already enjoying strong bookings
    and sales with many models
    already reported to be out of
    stock. So long as the
    government continues to
    focus on measures towards
    fiscal consolidation, the risk
    of Malaysia’s sovereign
    rating being downgraded is
    low, given international
    rating agencies are likely to
    consider these consolidation efforts. Likewise, rating agencies are very unlikely to downgrade Malaysia’s
    sovereign rating until a revised Budget for 2019 is unveiled by the new government on 2 November.</p>

<p>Moreover, the government debts are largely denominated in the ringgit, with only 3% denominated in
    foreign currency. Although foreign holding of Malaysian government securities amounted to 41.9% as of
    end-May, there is sufficient domestic liquidity to absorb any outflow of funds given Malaysia’s fairly well
    developed asset management and insurance industries. In all fairness, the current state of both the equity
    and bond markets cannot be an accurate barometer of how the broader Malaysian economy will perform
    over the medium to longer term.</p>

<p>In the light of a slew of revelations made in the name of
    competency, accountability and transparency (CAT) – with
    the ultimate motive of cleaning up a humongous sum of
    financial burdens inherited from the previous government –
    the country can be perceived to be in good hands given its
    finances will not be allowed to bleed any further. One
    effective measure to boost investor confidence in the
    Malaysian economy has been the shake-ups involving
    politically-linked head honchos ranging from key public
    service office bearers to government-linked companies
    (GLCs).</p>

<p>The services of controversial attorney-general (AG) Tan Sri
    Mohamed Apandi Ali were terminated following the
    appointment of Tommy Thomas to replace him. Treasury
    secretary-general Tan Sri Dr Mohd Irwan Serigar Abdullah
    was transferred out of his position and was placed under
    the Public Service Department till 13 June when his
    shortened contract expired.</p>

<p>Bank Negara Malaysia governor Tan Sri Muhammad
    Ibrahim has tendered his resignation after just two years of
    a five-year term, amid criticism that the Barisan Nasionalled government had used funds from the central bank’s
    recent land deal to pay for debts associated with 1Malaysia
    Development Bhd (1MDB). Following in Muhammad’s
    footsteps is Telekom Malaysia Bhd’s managing director and
    group CEO Datuk Seri Mohammed Shazalli Ramly. </p>

<p>Also intriguing is Dr Mahathir’s revival of his Look East
    Policy, which can perhaps be deemed as striking an
    equilibrium in Malaysia’s over-dependency on China’s
    economic prowess (as can be witnessed in megainfrastructure projects) while serving as an impetus to woo
    Japanese investments into Malaysia. There has also been a
    positive response to Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir
    Mohamad’s request for a yen loan.</p>

**Investment Strategies**</h3>

<p>We have always adhered to our bottom-up stock picking
    strategy by focusing on undervalued stocks whose
    fundamentals are deemed superior and sustainable. These
    are not the typical ‘index stocks’. We prefer to keep close to
    the ground by interviewing corporate management and having a thorough understanding of the business
    model, management quality, certainty of earnings growth and the potential risks of the companies we invest
    in.
    </p>

<p>On the same note, we are not keen to change our strategies each year, given such a move is simply not
    logical; as unexpected incidents or geopolitical events happen pretty frequently, we have to rely on a
    consistency in our evaluation processes to help us ride those market highs and to weather the lows. For investment themes, we believe the GLC reform theme will continue with the new government focusing on
    institutional reform by shaping better corporate governance. </p>

<p>Banks are likely to benefit from improved optimism on the economic outlook spurring higher consumer
    spending and private investment. Likewise, the consumer sector is expected to get a lift from the
    abolishment of GST. The oil & gas sector will benefit from firmer oil prices and the gradual recovery of
    capex spending by Petronas. We also look forward to stronger corporate earnings growth for the next one
    to two years, to be underpinned by solid gross domestic product (GDP) and private consumption growth.</p>

<p>Finally, the roll-out of comprehensive fiscal plan to address the country’s fiscal consolidation could be a rerating catalyst for the market and currency in the medium to long-term. These are the key investment
    themes that we are watching and intend to leverage on in the future. Our projection is that the benchmark
    FBM KLCI will stay volatile in the near term before staging a meaningful rebound towards the final quarter
    of 2018. In fact, investors would have a clearer picture of new government policies after the 100- day ‘inoffice’ period and upon the tabling of the 2019 Budget on 2 November.</p>
