  Budget 2019 has been a surprise in that it turned out to be another

      Budget instead of a "sacrificial" Budget as was widely anticipated. For the investor
      fraternity, Budget 2019 should be seen in the light of providing clarity on policy
      direction as well as the rolling out of reform initiatives to turn around the Malaysian
      economy amid uncertainties of sorts in the external environment. There is an optimal
      mix of stimulus, incentives and safeguards to navigate what is expected to be another
      challenging year ahead. Against a backdrop of the nation incurring RM1.065 tril real debt and liability as of
      end-June 2018, understandably, a slew of belt-tightening measures is inevitable to keep the economy
      afloat to enable the government to fulfil its social obligations.

<p>Budget 2019 has been a surprise in that it turned out to be another expansionary
    Budget instead of a "sacrificial" Budget as was widely anticipated. For the investor
    fraternity, Budget 2019 should be seen in the light of providing clarity on policy
    direction as well as the rolling out of reform initiatives to turn around the Malaysian
    economy amid uncertainties of sorts in the external environment. There is an optimal
    mix of stimulus, incentives and safeguards to navigate what is expected to be another
    challenging year ahead. Against a backdrop of the nation incurring RM1.065 tril real debt and liability as of
    end-June 2018, understandably, a slew of belt-tightening measures is inevitable to keep the economy
    afloat to enable the government to fulfil its social obligations.</p>

**Assortment Of Taxes**

<p>Striking a balance is always a difficult exercise in economic manoeuvring. As a trade-off for the abolition of
    the indirect Goods and Services Tax (GST) - where a shortfall of RM19 bil abounds from the introduction of
    the Sales and Service Tax (SST) - it makes valid sense for the government to pursue other means of taxrelated income (the GST was projected to generate RM43 bil a year while the SST is targeted to generate
    only RM24 bil year). On that note, the absence of capital gain, inheritance and carbon taxes are indeed a
    welcome relief for investors. Likewise, there was no mention of a sin tax in the context of breweries and
    tobacco companies. Nevertheless, a post-budget excise duty hike cannot be ruled out in the coming
    months, although this is very unlikely given that the government had recently increased the SST rate for
    alcohol and cigarettes. However, the much-talked-about digital and soda taxes were introduced alongside
    the casino tax, stamp duty for high-end properties and real property gain tax (RPGT).</p>

<p>These can be construed as
    negative for the gaming,
    food and beverage (F&B)
    and property sectors,
    respectively. The gaming
    sector is a major loser with
    the annual gaming licence
    fee for casinos to be raised
    from RM120 mil to RM150
    mil while the gaming tax on
    casinos is to be raised to
    35% of gross gaming
    revenue. This has led to
    Genting Malaysia Bhd and
    Genting Bhd being
    subjected to a knee-jerk
    reaction (both stocks
    dipping as much as 30%
    and 12% respectively on
    the first post-Budget 2019
    trading day) while research houses aggressively trim the earnings forecasts of both casino-related
    counters.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, number forecast operators are spared from incurring the wrath of both gaming tax and
    betting duty except that the number of special draws will be slashed by half. In the case of the real estate
    sector, the additional 1% in stamp duty (to a maximum of 4% from the previous 3%) on the transfer of
    property valued above RMi mil is deemed milder than expected, while that of RPGT imposition on
    properties priced above RM200,00 (from 0% to 5% for Malaysians and to 5% to 10% for companies and
    foreigners) from the sixth year of ownership could be a blessing in that it may encourage property owners
    to hold 011 to their assets to reap better appreciation value. </p>

<p>To lift sales and clear inventories, the government has mooted what is deemed as the first-in the-world
    "property crowd funding" platform as an alternative source of financing for first-time homebuyers in addition to the Real Estate and Housing Developers' Association Malaysia (REHDA) agreeing to reduce prices of
    houses by as much as 10% (this follows SST exemption on construction materials). Elsewhere, Malaysia
    will also for the first time, impose a two-pronged excise tax of 40 sen/litre on sweetened beverages (i.e.
    containing added sugar of more than 5gm per 100ml drink) starting from April 1 next year. This is as much
    an effort to encourage Malaysians to lead a healthier lifestyle, given that a study by the Health Ministry
    found that nearly one in two Malaysians are overweight or obese. Such moves may not augur well for F&B
    companies like Dutch Lady Milk Industries Bhd, Nestle (M) Bhd and Fraser & Neave Holdings Bhd in the
    long term.</p>

**Lifting The Construction Sector Gloom** 

<p>Elsewhere, austerity measures focusing on cost rationalisation involving mega infrastructure projects are
    also welcomed although they will somehow hurt the revenue/profit projections of the listed contractors. The
    measures, among others: </p>

<p>o The government's commitment to the mega infrastructure projects will somehow restore investors'
    confidence in the construction sector given the KL Construction Index, which measures the
    performance of stocks under that sector, has dipped almost 42% from 281.13 on the eve of the
    May 2018 general election to close at 163.34 as of Oct 30</p>

<p>o Aside from the MRT2 and LRT3, other mega infrastructure projects - the East Coast Rail Link
    (ECRL), KL-Singapore High Speed Rail (HSR) and MRT3 - will continue to be shelved pending
    future review. </p>

<p>PETRONAS Chipping In
</p>

<p>Amid higher global oil prices, the government is expected to collect revenue of RM261.8 bil including a
    special dividend of RM30 bil from Petronas (2018: estimated RM24 bil; 2017: RM16 bil). Essentially, the
    special dividend has enabled the government to grow revenue by 10.7% to RM261.8 bil, hence containing
    its fiscal deficit at 3.4% or RM52.1 bil despite operating expenditure growing by 10.7% to RM259.9 bil.
    While these improvements should be viewed positively by rating agencies, the fact that revenue will see a
    2% or RM4.7 bil decline in 2019 without Petronas' special dividend contribution could raise a red flag which
    will ultimately become a thorn in their evaluation</p>

<p>Moreover, slower global economic growth and a rise in
    supply from oil majors, namely the US, Saudi Arabia, Libya
    and Russia, may see crude price fall below US$70/barrel in
    2019, thus posing a risk for Malaysia to achieve its fiscal
    revenue target. It is hoped that rating agencies in the likes of
    Fitch. S&P and Moody's would look beyond the special
    dividend factor (or even the abolition of GST) given the
    government is initiating new revenue sources (vis-a-vis the
    introduction of new forms of taxes) or has embarked on a
    major move to pare debts and other liabilities through a
    concerted effort to plug wastages (curbing overstaffing in the
    civil service or payment of fat salaries Source: TA Securities to key personnel) and leakages (combating
    corruption and abuses of funding). Moreover, rating agencies should also take cognisant of the following
    initiatives: • The setting up of a national Debt Management Office to review and manage government debts
    and liabilities, and monitor new debt issuance by government, statutory bodies and special purpose
    vehicles, and • The Ministry of Finance (MoF) to helm a special task force to review the role and function of
    MoF-owned firms and statutory bodies to avoid duplication and direct competition with the private sector.</p>

**Moving Forward**

<p>At a glance, the higher-than expected budget deficit numbers may prompt foreign investors to shy away
    from the local market in the short term. Likewise, there is pressure on the ringgit judging from the deficit
    numbers. Overall, Budget 2019 bodes well for the investor community by having primarily lifted the gloom
    pertaining to policy direction and the type of reform Malaysia is embarking on to rebuild its economy and
    financial position. In all fairness, it can be deemed as a decent budget that attempts to bridge the fiscal gap
    with high impact projects and targeted subsidies without negatively impacting economic growth and
    burdening the wider populace with new taxes. </p>
