Please be informed that we have appointed Kenanga Investment Bank Berhad as the new Shariah Adviser of the Fund effective 1 January 2019 and have amended the information in the First Replacement Disclosure Document dated 28 October 2014 as amended by the First Supplemental Disclosure Document dated 31 March 2015 and the Second Supplemental Disclosure Document dated 8 February 2017. 

This is to reflect changes made to the investment restriction whereby the Securities Commission Malaysia (“SC”) has on 14 November 2018, approved the variation in compliance with the requirements of paragraph (10) of Schedule B of the Guidelines which states that “except for investments by core funds, the value of a fund’s investments in units/ shares of any collective investment scheme must not exceed 20% of the fund’s net asset value.” 

This variation allows us to invest as follows: 

a) Kenanga OnePRS Conservative Fund: Up to 80% NAV in any collective investment scheme for a five-year period from 20 November 2018 or NAV reaching RM30 million, whichever earlier. 

b) Kenanga OnePRS Moderate Fund: Up to 95% NAV in any collective investment scheme for a five-year period from 20 November 2018 or NAV reaching RM30 million, whichever earlier. 

c) Kenanga OnePRS Growth Fund: Up to 70% NAV in any collective investment scheme for a 6- month period from 20 November 2018 until 19 May 2019. The abovementioned amendments have been reflected in the Second Replacement Disclosure Document dated 20 February 2019.
