<p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is the sixth-largest economy in the
    world, according to a Deloitte report in September. The alliance, made up of ten nations,
    presents to the asset management industry an investment opportunity that is expected to
    grow to between USD3 and USD4 trillion by 2025. is asset under management
    opportunity is projected to include institutional, high-net-worth (HNW), and retail
    segments.</p>

<p>“It is interesting how the industry has grown now that we
    have more access to big data. However, at the end of the
    day, there is still an advisory role to be played by our asset
    and wealth advisers.” Ismitz Matthew De Alwis would know
    what he is talking about, being the Chief Executive Officer
    for Kenanga Investors, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    Kenanga Investment Bank Berhad. The company offers
    investment solutions including collective investment
    schemes, portfolio management services, segregated
    private mandates, and alternative investments.” “Kenanga
    Investors started as mainly an institutional and pension
    focus fund house when we took over ING in 2013. Since
    then we have evolved and expanded to build diverse
    products, especially retail funds.”</p>

<p>Ismitz’s 25 years’ worth of experience in the fields of financial and investment
    management, adds to his leadership capabilities in managing Kenanga Investors. “Today
    in less than 3 years, we have mixed assets which are about 40% retail, 40% institutional
    and 20% wholesale. Our flagship fund Kenanga Growth Fund (KGF), a long-term capital
    growth fund, has grown 12 times and now stands at almost USD350 million,” Ismitz said.</p>

<p>The company has initiated its private wealth arm to provide financial advisory services to
    HNW investors and ultra-high net worth individuals, to meet their investment needs and
    accelerate their wealth accumulation. Within the category of fixed income where it offers
    Islamic bonds (sukuk) and conventional ones, its Islamic products are focused on
    equities and fixed income funds, a potential growth area. In recognition of the diverse
    market that it serves, Kenanga Investors has dedicated specialised managers to serve
    different segments which allow the company to build sustainable relationships with its
    clients. The specialised managers do this by attuning to the clients’ needs as their wealth
    grows and offer them specific products that those needs. “There is a global Islamic
    wealth pool of around USD11-12 trillion that could be unlocked in the years ahead. We
    launched our Asia Pacific fund in 2013 which focuses on absolute returns. Subsequently,
    we launched an ASEAN fund that has delivered a stable 8% return. Even though some of
    the countries can offer double digit growth, it is highly volatile. We do not take
    unnecessary risks,” Ismitz said.</p>

<p>Much like other industries evolving due to the advancements in technology, the company recognises the need to keep up with the demands of its clients. “Toensure that we are always
    abreast with these advancements, we continuously conduct exhausting research to determine market readiness. We recently launched an artificial
    intelligence (AI) fund after some careful consideration and in-depth industry research,”
    Ismitz said. Kenanga Global Multi-Asset Fund (“KGMAF”) is Malaysia’s first AI-driven
    fund and leverages on breakthroughs in AI to identify profit opportunities from short-term
    predictive relationships in pricing and volume data. It then constructs portfolios with a
    focus on capital preservation based on forecasts of instruments’ movements.</p>

<p>“For the past two years, we have been
    building our expertise and track record on
    regional equities in Asia Pacific, and
    ASEAN, including fixed incomes, which
    will continue to open new avenues and
    unlock funds among institutional and
    private investors in both conventional and
    Islamic finance.”</p>

<p> 2017 was an exciting year for Kenanga Investors; they were accredited with three awards
    for KGF, and also won the Best Equity Group (Islamic) at the Lipper Fund Awards 2017,
    and the inaugural Fundsupermart.com’s Investors’ Choice – Fund House of the Year</p>

<p>2017. The new year started off well, and brought a triple recognition from the 2018 Best
    of the Best Awards by Asia Asset Management to its Chief Investment Officer, while
    Ismitz himself was named Malaysia CEO of the Year. Its reputation as a pension fund
    manager was further solidified when the Hong Kong-based publication awarded it the title
    of Best Pension Fund Manager.</p>
