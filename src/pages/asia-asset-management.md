<p>KIG Chief Investment Officer Lee Sook Yee says the company’s success in growing the
    AUM is driven by its customer-focused approach. “We are very focused on investments
    and solving clients’ needs, whether that be for diversification, the need for income and/or
    returns, or to manage risk,” Ms. Lee tells Asia Asset Management (AAM). “We think it’s
    important to be able to provide a very broad platform that allows us to offer good
    solutions to our clients. It is also important for us as an active manager to be focussed on high conviction, active investing and to be able to deliver absolute returns or outperform
    the benchmark.”</p>

<h3>Netting A Hat-trick</h3>

<p>KIG was recognised in AAM’s Best of the Best 2018 Awards in three country categories,
    namely CEO of the Year (Malaysia), CIO of the Year (Malaysia), and Best Pension Fund
    Manager (Malaysia). These awards were well-deserved, as KIG, under the leadership of
    Chief Executive Officer Ismitz Matthew De Alwis, has successfully grown its pension fund
    mandates.</p>

<p>Mr. De Alwis, who joined KIG in 2014 and was appointed as CEO in 2015, recalls the
    early days when he was tasked with revitalising KIG, as the company had experienced
    declines in AUM and major key accounts. “It has not been an easy journey to get to
    where we are in 2018,” Mr. De Alwis says. As part of his strategy for KIG, Mr. De Alwis
    says that the company began its transformation journey by focusing on strengthening its
    capabilities and competencies in three key pillars: product and service innovation,
    distribution excellence, and operational efficiency and effectiveness. “As a result, today
    we have superior investment risk analytics processes in place which has further boosted
    our investment performance,” Mr. De Alwis says. “We have expanded our distribution
    reach to include mass-retail, high net-worth individuals, corporate clients, provident fund
    providers and platform distributors.”

<p>Today, KIG’s domestic pension funds mandates have shown strong improvements and
    its domestic pension fund business has increased by 116% in fund size compared to
    2014. During the same period (2014-2017), the entire Malaysian asset management
    industry has increased by 23% from 629.9 billion ringgit to 776.2 billion ringgit. While Mr.
    De Alwis is pleased with the achievements, he does not sit on his laurels. He believes
    KIG needs to continue with its focus on the three pillars, as well as other areas, including
    digitalisation, fintech, reward optimisation for investments, tailored solutions and
    alternative investments. “To this end, we need to optimise our asset allocation skillset
    and diversify our investment strategy to provide customised solutions for clients. We are
    also working to establish a multiproduct, multi-model and multi-channel distribution
    platform. Beefing up the risk control capability of our products to meet regulatory criteria
    is also vital going forward,” he says.</p>

**Staying Motivated And Diversified </h3>**

<p>Mr. De Alwis admits that staying motivated in a highly competitive financial environment
    is a challenge. His driver, he says, is focusing on values that he is passionate about. “As
    CEO of KIG, as well as a family man, I am especially passionate about the current
    retirement environment in Malaysia. I believe Malaysians need to be educated and
    empowered with well-thought-through retirement plans,” Mr. De Alwis says.</p>

<p>“As the government began highlighting that the average level of the Employees Provident
    Fund (EPF) wouldn’t be able to sustain Malaysians through their old age, we must look to
    intensify our efforts in education to get investors prepared to face their retirement.”

<p>He also attributes KIG’s success in this year’s Best of the Best Awards to the KIG
    employees, which comprise a workforce from diverse backgrounds and talents. “We have
    always held strong to the fact that ‘Diversity is Strength’ and we are stronger due to our
    differences. Each and every one of us brings a different perspective or view to the table
    and this enhances our processes, strategies and offerings that go out to the public,” he
    says. “We are proud of our existing track record, and our high standards in the services
    we offer. I believe this is what motivates us a team to always deliver consistent results
    and we expect nothing less to live up to our brand name.”
