<h2>Steady Improvements In Several Economies Are Helping To Strengthen The Region’s Investment Appeal</h2>

<p>INVESTOR sentiment for emerging
    markets – including those in Asia – has
    been poor in recent times. A key
    contributing factor to this was the collapse
    of commodity prices, most notably crude
    oil, which has fallen sharply over the past
    two years.</p>

<p>The slowing of the Chinese economy also
    brought fears that its years of high growth
    were coming to an end, making a hard
    landing inevitable. Recall that the middle
    of last year and early this year saw a
    period of heightened volatility in China’s
    stock markets, with the devaluation (Aug
    11 last year) of the renminbi further
    affecting financial markets</p>
  
<p>However, as the impact of these pressures ease with macroeconomic indicators beginning to
    show improvement, the investment case for several Asian countries is becoming more attractive,
    according to market observers. </p>

<p>“We believe that we might have reached a turning point for Asian equities,” Fundsupermart.com
    senior research analyst Lee Tien Xiang tells FocusM.</p>

<p>Particularly bullish on Asian equities, Fundsupermart.com foresees as much as 40% upside over
    the next two years.</p>

<p>“They \[Asian equities] have become more attractive given the \[previous] dampening factors on
    the regional market such as the collapse in the commodity market and the deceleration in China’s
    economic growth have been subsiding,” Lee further suggests.</p>

**China’s Recovery</h3>**

<p>This sentiment is also echoed by Kenanga Investors Berhad senior portfolio manager
    (investment) Christopher Kok, who compares the growth potential of the Asian region versus
    more developed economies.</p>

<p>“We are bullish on Asian equities because we think this is one of the few regions that will show
    strong growth moving forward,” Kok tells FocusM. “In developed countries such as the US and
    Europe, GDP growth is forecast at about 2% and 1.5% respectively whereas Asia’s GDP is
    forecast to grow about 5% to 6%.</p>

<p>A key factor in Asia’s brightening outlook is the improving health of China’s economy, say the
    experts. While the overall growth in the world’s second-largest economy is still expected to
    moderate, there has been an overall improvement in its macro activities which will pave the way
    for a relatively stable path, according to CIMB-Principal Asset Management Bhd chief investment
    officer Patrick Chang.</p>

<p>“The continued efforts from China’s financial market liberalisation may provide catalysts to drive
    fund inflows and support market sentiment,” says Chang. “The liberalisation of its stock markets –
    first through the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect and the upcoming scheme for Shenzhen –
    should open up further opportunities in China’s investable stock universe.”</p>

<p>Moreover, China’s market valuation is reasonable at financial year 2016 (FY16) price-earnings
    ratio of 11.8 times while its earnings per share growth stands at 15%.</p>

<p>Fundsupermart.com’s Lee believes the concerns over China’s high corporate debt levels and
    overcapacity issues have been exaggerated. “People remain way too pessimistic even though we
    have started to witness the impact of these negative issues on China and other Asian countries,
    dissipating,” he argues.</p>

<p>China’s corporate debt levels are high, but most of it is government-backed, while most nonperforming loans are held by state-owned banks which are well-capitalised with significant capital
    adequacy ratios, Lee points out. Overcapacity is also being managed as industrial players have
    pared down their inventory levels.</p>

<p>High Earnings And Commodity Prices</p>

<p>Industrial enterprise profits in China have also grown positively (on a year-on-year basis) since
    early this year and this data tends to be highly correlated to non-financial corporate earnings.
    Such a trend indicates stronger earnings growth which is very positive.</p>

<p>“Continued positive growth in industrial enterprise profit will lend support to the earnings of
    Chinese corporates going forward,” Lee rationalises.</p>

<p>On a bigger picture, the producer price index (PPI) has also been in positive territory since
    September and this suggests that prices being paid for producers’ output is rising. This will
    eventually translate into higher earnings for manufacturers.</p>

<p>Concurring, CIMB-Principal’s Chang says after two lackluster years, corporate earnings growth
    throughout the region is expected to recover next year. He expects growth to be in the region of
    5% to 10%</p>

<p>The other factor that is driving optimism over Asia is the belief that commodity prices may have
    bottomed out. After the plunge early this year, commodity prices have rebounded swiftly followed
    by a period of stabilisation, albeit with moderate volatility over the past few months. Moving
    forward, a gradual normalisation process can even be expected for oil prices, adds Lee.</p>

<p>Importantly, both commodity exporters
    and importers are also able to ride on the
    gradual uptrend pace given Asian
    countries, some of which are commodity
    net importers, are likely to grow resiliently
    and at relatively high levels compared to
    their developed counterparts elsewhere.</p>

<h2>“We are bullish on Asian equities
    because we think this is one of the
    few regions that will show strong
    growth moving forward. In developed
    countries such as the US and
    Europe, GDP growth is forecast at
    about 2% and 1.5% respectively
    whereas Asia’s GDP is forecast to
    grow about 5% to 6%.” - Kok</h2>

**Key Benefactors</h3>**

<p>Zooming in on China, Kenanga’s Kok
    urges investors to consider specific
    sectors with promising outlooks such as
    the internet sector</p>

<p>“Poor traditional retail experiences have led many consumers to embrace e-commerce… more
    than 10% of retail purchases are made online,” he justifies. ”There are also opportunities in the
    technology space and clean energy sphere as they are part of the government’s policy to move
    China up to value chain.”</p>

<p>Pointing to other East Asian countries likes Taiwan and South Korea, he highlights industries
    involved in secular trends such as automated driving and virtual reality. He believes companies
    providing such business options will be able to drive demand and continue to provide earnings
    momentum.</p>
    
<p>Fundsupermart.com’s Lee is also keen on Taiwan’s industrial sector. His view is that the country
    will benefit from greater demand for technological products, electronic devices as well as mobile
    applications from China. Elsewhere, Thailand and Indonesia are also attractive as their internal
    restructuring and improvement efforts begin to pay dividends.</p>

<p>Kenanga’s Kok also likes Indonesia due to its decent GDP forecast of above 5% coupled with
    structural reforms aimed at improving the ease of doing business. Furthermore, he regards the
    recent tax amnesty as an opportunity to boost government revenue while improving liquidity in
    the domestic economy</p>

**Malaysian To Benefit</h3>**

<p>With many economies in Asia improving, Malaysia too stands to reap some benefits. This will
    come from a mix of factors including the positive spillover effects from a better Chinese economy,
    stronger earnings growth among local players and higher commodity prices, say analysts.</p>
    
<p>Kenanga Investors Bhd senior portfolio manager (investment) Christopher Kok notes that equities
    have suffered because earnings growth had slowed down, particularly due to lower commodity
    prices. However, he expects earnings growth to improve next year, in tandem with GDP growth
    which is also expected to rebound after three consecutive years of slowdown.</p>

<p>“As corporate earnings are leverage to overall growth in the economy, we should also see a
    similar trend there which will be positive for the market,” reckons Kok. “This is also supported by
    improving commodity prices and accommodative monetary and fiscal policy.” </p>

**Largest Trading Partner</h3>**

<p>The slowdown in the Chinese economy also played a part given that it is Malaysia’s largest
    trading partner. Therefore, a recovery in the Chinese economy will also be positive for exporters.</p>
    
<p>“Our main exports to China include electrical and electronic products, chemicals and chemical
    products, petroleum-based products and palm oil and palm oil-based products,” lists CIMBPrincipal Asset Management Bhd chief investment officer Patrick Chang. “As the Chinese
    economy stabilises and recovers, demand for these products will definitely increase.”</p>

<p>Furthermore, as China embarks on its One Belt, One Road initiative, he expects more foreign
    direct investment from China which will further spur the economy.</p>

<p>The inflow of Chinese investments has already begun in earnest. In a recent high-level
    government visit to China led by the Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, both countries have
    committed to understake investments to the tune of RM144 bil. A wide array of projects have
    been identified, ranging from properly developments, steel production, solar cell production, port
    development and technology park to the RM55 bil East Coast Rail Link.</p>
