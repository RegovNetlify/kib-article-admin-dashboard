<p><b>1. What is your outlook for Asian equities in the next two years?</b> </p>

<p>We are bullish on Asian equities, because we think that the Asia region is one of the few regions that
    will bring growth moving forward. If you look at developed markets like US and Europe, they are
    actually showing 2% growth forecasted in the next two years, whereas Asia’s forecast GDP growth is
    about 5% to 6%, and corporate earnings growth should be even stronger than that. Therefore, it is one
    of the only regions where investors may experience growth for their investments. Although there are
    risks generally arising from high debt particularly in China, we think the government has the capability
    and willingness to contain it for now.</p>
  
<p><b>2. Fundsupermart Research Team made a bold call of 40% upside potential for Asian equities by
    end of 2018. Do you agree with their call? </b> </p>

<p>We can get a gauge of the return by looking at the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index as a measure of the
    market. We know that return is a function of both the earnings and the multiple that is paid on those
    earnings. Looking at the consensus forecast, companies in the index are expected to post earnings
    growth of 12.5% in 2017 and 11% in 2018. Assuming the earnings multiple does not change, we thus
    see a roughly 24% upside in 2-years driven from earnings alone.</p>

<p>The earnings multiple would be harder to predict. Two of the key things that determine this are the long
    term growth and the risk. For the multiple to expand, it would require realisation of new growth avenues
    or a dissipation of risk that currently surrounds the market. While we think there is some scope for
    multiple re-ratings as domestic demand and liquidity gain critical mass, this is a long term trend which
    might take longer than the next 2 years. </p>

<p><b>3. Within Asia, is there any particular country or sector that you are bullish about?</b> </p>

<p>We are positive with the tech and internet sector across North Asia (China, South Korea and Taiwan)
    as new secular trends like flexible OLED, automated driving and virtual reality continue to drive
    demand. These key factors will continue to provide earnings growth for companies moving forward.</p>

<p>For the internet sector, e-commerce is still forecasted to grow at double-digit CAGRs for the next few
    years. Asia’s massive population of >4bn people provides tremendous opportunities for internet
    companies to achieve scale.</p>

<p>In South-East Asia, we like Indonesia due to decent growth (>5% forecasted) alongside structural
    reforms such as improving the ease of doing business, infrastructure and also tax collection.
    Meanwhile, inflation has fallen to multi-year lows of about 3% - 4%, which enables an easier monetary
    policy. A recent tax amnesty programme is also expected to boost government revenue by as much as
    USD9-10bn while also improving liquidity in the domestic economy. Additionally, there should be
    cyclical support as commodity prices bottom out. </p>

<p><b>4. What are the key risks that investors should be aware of? How is your strategy positioned to mitigate these risks?</b> </p>

<p>Into 2017, global monetary policy is still the key to watch as it will have an impact on capital flows into
    Asian markets. Diverging monetary policy in the US and Euro region would lead to a stronger USD and
    would be negative for emerging markets. Historically, movements in the USD have been highly
    correlated with the performance of Asian stock markets. Although we think this will become less
    important in the future as Asian markets become more domestically driven, it will still remain correlated
    in the medium term.</p>

<p>Another key risk is stability in China, the largest economy in Asia as total debt to GDP (Public +
    Households + Corporates excluding financial) has exceeded 250% of GDP. The risk point lies in corporate debt, while the government and households still remain relatively lowly geared. Keys to
    monitor are the property market, capital outflows and the amount of liquidity in the system.</p>

<p>For Kenanga, our strategy as always remains bottom-up driven and concentrated in companies which
    show structural growth. Hence we tend to dislike companies which are affected by government policy.
    We also place emphasis on the quality of the company, and prefer companies with earnings stability
    and strong balance sheet. Hence, we think these companies are able to weather any downturn
    relatively better. We constantly monitor key macro trends as well, for example; the Chinese property
    market and its currency movements to ensure that we are well positioned for any market movement.</p>

<p><b>5. Malaysian equities didn’t perform well this year. What are the reasons for the lack-lustre performance? With oil prices stabilizing and 2017 budget out, is there any catalyst?</b> </p>

<p>Malaysian equities have suffered because earnings growth has slowed down. This is partly due to low
    commodity prices. Going forward into 2017, earnings growth is predicted to experience a turnaround as
    GDP growth is also expected to rebound after three consecutive years of slowdown. GDP growth
    decelerated from 6% in 2014 to 5% in 2015 and to an estimated 4.1% for 2016. Next year, we forecast
    a rebound to 4.4%. Though this may seem like a small increment, it is nevertheless a change in trend;
    there is an actual increase after two years of downtrend. As corporate earnings are leveraged to overall
    growth in the economy, we should also see a similar trend there which will be positive for the market.
    Additionally, this is supported by improving commodity prices and also an accommodative monetary
    and fiscal policy. </p>

<p><b>6. Which unit trusts would you recommend investors to take advantage of in rising Asian Equity markets?</b> </p>

<p>Our Kenanga Asia Pacific Total Return Fund (“KAPTRF”) is weighted predominantly into North Asian
    markets, while our Kenanga ASEAN Tactical Total Return Fund (“KATTRF”) funds gives investors
    exposure to structural themes in ASEAN markets such as rising infrastructure spending and rising
    consumption. As we are also positive on Malaysia in 2017, investors can also position themselves in
    Kenanga Malaysian Inc Fund (“KMIF”). For more specific mandates like dividend, we recommend the
    Kenanga Premier Fund (“KPF”), while for small-caps, we recommend the Kenanga Growth
    Opportunities Fund (“KGOF”). </p>
