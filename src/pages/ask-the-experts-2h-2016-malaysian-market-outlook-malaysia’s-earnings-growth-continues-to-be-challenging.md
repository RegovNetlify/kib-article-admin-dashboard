        <p>Mr Liong thinks that the weakness in GDP growth is attributed to weak export and private
            investments. Nevertheless, the government has taken measures to boost consumer disposable
            income, which include minimum wage hike, cut of 3% EPF contribution, and civil servants pay hike.
            In addition to that, the government has taken measures to implement more infrastructure projects
            including MRT 2, LRT 3, etc. Bank Negara has also cut Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) rate by 25
            basis points to 3% which will lend support to Malaysia's GDP growth.</p>

    <li><p><b>How much further upside is there for investors and are valuations still appealing? FBM KLCI
        Index continued to see earnings downgrades on a year-to-date basis, with analysts slashing
        earnings forecasts by -3.4% and -3.9% for 2016 and 2017. What is your take on the earnings
        outlook?</b> </p>

        <p>He thinks there is limited upside to the market as earnings have been disappointing for the FBM
            KLCI, and earnings came in quite weak in March 2016 reporting quarter. The disappointment came
            from various sectors such as plantations, oil and gas, timber, etc. Only the airline sector
            outperformed while banks and telcos were generally in line. So, he thinks that the earnings growth
            will continue to be challenging for the rest of the year.</p>

    <li><p><b>Do you think small-cap segment is a better investment opportunity at this point of time as
        compared to the big cap segment? Why?</b> </p>
    
    <p>The investment team in Kenanga Investors Berhad adopts a bottom-up approach which means they
        look at earnings growth, valuations and dividend yield in terms of stock picking. As long as stocks
        offer reasonable valuations, good earnings growth and attractive dividend yield, they think that
        these stocks offer attractive investment opportunities. So regardless of the big cap or small cap,
        they tend to look at stocks from the quality perspective.</p>
    </li>

    <li><p><b>Where do you find investment opportunities in Malaysia? What sectors or themes do you
        have the most and least preference for?</b> </p>
    
    <p>They are constantly looking for new investment ideas. As there is limited upside to the market, they
        look at non-index stocks. Regardless of the economy environment, they believe there are
        companies who can deliver earnings growth. They prefer defensive sectors such as consumer (F&B
        sector), utilities, REITs as they offer 5-7% dividend yield and construction. Oil and gas as well as
        plantations are two sectors they have the least preference for due to weak CPO price and oil price.</p></li>

    <li><p><b>Do you think investors should opt for investments with a dividend investing strategy amid a
        slowing economy and increasingly volatile markets?</b> </p>
        
    <p>He thinks investors should always select unit trusts that are compatible with their investment
        objectives and risk tolerance. In this increasingly volatile market environment, dividend investing
        strategy is likely to do well relative to the market. If Bank Negara continues to cut-rate, then
        dividend stocks will likely to outperform the market. However, he thinks that investors should not
        disregard other stocks that could deliver good earnings growth as they could also outperform the
        market.</p></li>
