<p><b>1. Malaysia’s gross domestic product (“GDP”) was revised upward by the World Bank and it
    has forecasted that Malaysia’s economy will grow by 4.9% compared with the earlier
    forecast of 4.3% in its January report. What is your forecast and outlook for Malaysia’s
    economy for the rest of the year?</b> </p>
  
<p>Following the stronger than expected 1Q GDP growth of 5.6% yoy which beats estimate of 4.8%
    year-on-year (“yoy”), we have seen economists upgrading 2017’s GDP growth. Based on the latest
    Bloomberg statistics, consensus is now expecting 2017 GDP growth of 4.7%. During last year’s
    budget announcement in October 2016, the Ministry of Finance (“MOF”) has given a projected 2017
    GDP growth range of 4%-5%. We expect 2017 growth to come in at the higher end of the MOF’s
    forecast range. We continue to have a positive outlook for the economy in 2017. Stronger growth is
    boosted by higher commodity prices, sustained infrastructure spending and higher exports.</p>

<p><b>2. What is your view on Malaysia’s record low purchasing manager’s index (“PMI) in June? Is
    this an early sign of economic slowdown?</b> </p>

<p>Malaysia’s June manufacturing PMI fell to the low of 46.9 in June after climbing to a high of 50.7 in
    April. The survey however, revealed an uptick in June exports with new orders abroad increasing.
    We note that the industrial production index (“IPI”) growth was above 4.0% for the past three
    months, which was above 2016’s monthly average of 3.8%. This leads us to believe that
    manufacturing was likely going through a soft patch as June was the fasting month which is
    seasonally, a slower month. We expect manufacturing to gradually pick up and continue its growth
    path despite it being at a moderate pace compared to 1H2017</p>

<p><b>3. Malaysia’s corporate earnings growth in the first quarter 2017 is off to an encouraging start
    after two years of decline. How much further upside is there for investors and what is your
    take on the earnings outlook?</b> </p>

<p>After three years of disappointment, corporate earnings are finally back to growth in 2017. The
    consensus is now expecting 6%-7% earnings growth in 2017, which we believe is reasonably
    achievable. This will be supported by stronger infrastructure spending, foreign direct investment
    (“FDI”), higher commodity prices and also good export numbers.</p>

<p><b>4. Where do you find the most promising opportunities? Are there any sectors that are likely to
    do better this year?</b> </p>

<p>In Kenanga Investors, we always stick to our bottom-up stock picking strategy with less priority on
    sector calls. Our 2017 investment themes are centred on beneficiaries of infrastructure spending
    and rising China FDI, manufacturers or exporters with niche products, GLC reforms or restructuring
    plays and companies leveraged to domestic consumption.</p>

<p><b>5. Malaysia’s exports have recorded four consecutive months of double-digit growth in 2017. In
    your opinion, what is the reason behind the Electrical & Electronics (“E&E”) export surge
    over the recent months?</b> </p>

<p>Malaysia had very strong export growth for the first five months in 2017, driven by the recovery in
    commodities and E&E exports. Commodity prices especially oil and CPO price has recovered
    significantly yoy. Meanwhile, the surge in E&E exports was boosted by the upcoming iPhone
    replacement cycle. Most technology companies we visited</p>

<p><b>6. Malaysia small cap segment has rallied about 20% in the first half of 2017. What is your view
    on the local small cap segment? Do you think the rally is sustainable?</b> </p>

<p>After a very strong rally in the small-cap space, we now expect the small cap index to correct and
    consolidate in 3Q2017. Seasonally, we know that the 3Q is always the weakest and slowest of
    months for emerging markets, including Malaysia. Nonetheless, we continue to like the small-cap
    stocks which generally offer cheaper valuation and stronger potential earnings growth compared to
    large-cap stocks. In Kenanga Investors, our small caps investing strategy is always bottom-up stock
    picking backed by fundamental research and a thorough understanding of the company’s business
    model. Selective small caps with solid fundamentals which continue to deliver earnings growth will
    likely to continue its outperformance in 2H2017.</p>
