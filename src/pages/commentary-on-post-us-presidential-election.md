**Market Review</h3>**

<p>On Tuesday 8th November 2016, Donald Trump staged a surprise victory over Hillary in the now
    concluded U.S Presidential Elections. The initial market reaction was a sharp knee-jerk risk
    aversion as investors grappled with the uncertain policy outlook in US as Trump was widely
    perceived as a wildcard candidate. Asian markets plunged sharply while S&P 500 futures fell as
    much as 5% in intra-day trading. Price reaction moderated thereafter, and US market staged a
    strong rebound to post record highs as investors interpreted Trump’s pledges of fiscal stimulus
    and trade protectionism as highly inflationary and positive for dollar and equities. Emerging
    markets however, continued to be negatively impacted mostly led by large declines in currencies.
    In the bond markets, the surprise election result has caused heavy selling of US Treasuries. US
    Treasury 10 year yield has since jumped to 2.15% as of 10 November closing from 1.85% on 8
    November, the day before the presidential election. In tandem with yield increases across global
    bond markets, Malaysian government securities (MGS) also saw yields going higher, albeit in a
    more moderate amount. The 3 year, 5 year and 10 year MGS yields advanced to 3.24%, 3.45%
    and 3.78% separately on 10 November closing, compared to 3.08%, 3.32% and 3.66%
    respectively in the closing of 8 November.</p>

**Market Outlook</h3>**

<p>Key issue going forward lies mainly with the direction and stance of US policies in areas like
    immigration, trade and foreign relations in view of Trump’s anti-immigration, anti-free trade and
    anti-globalisation rhetoric. This may lead to higher inflation in US as protectionist policies impact
    the supply chain and cause cost-push price reaction, whilst putting pressure on EM currencies on
    trade volume disruptions. On the other hand, Trump plans for broad-based tax cuts, increased
    infrastructure and military spending will lead to stronger US growth and hence lending further
    support to USD. This may potentially cause further divergence in global monetary policy as US
    tightens while other regions ease to support their economies. Foreign capital flows into EM could
    reverse as carry trades unwind as they are deemed unattractive given the rising yields in US,
    causing EM equities to underperform.</p>
  
<p>In the near-term, uncertainty has emerged on the Fed’s monetary policy direction, with the
    probability of a rate hike in December somewhat reduced marginally. However, in the longer run,
    the Fed funds rate may normalise sooner than expected as inflation is driven up by fiscal
    expansion and infrastructure investment.</p>

**Strategy</h3>**

<p>Against these backdrops, we expect global financial markets to remain highly volatile in the
    shorter term. Importantly, we will need to have more clarity on Trump’s policies to give a better
    assessment. Only time will tell whether Trump’s controversial pledges are carried through after
    he takes office. Therefore, we advocate a defensive portfolio strategy amidst what remains a
    trading market in the short term, buying on weakness into names driven by domestic demand and
    resilient earnings (e.g. domestic consumption and infrastructure plays). We are also inclined to
    add positions into MYR plays (e.g. exporters) to hedge against the dollar strength.</p>

<p>In terms of bonds, further selling pressure on MGS is possible as MYR is expected to remain
    weak. However, Malaysian bonds still offer attractive yields compared to developed markets.We
    expect foreign buying to resume when things are more settled. In conclusion, due to the array of
    uncertainties, we shall adopt a neutral duration for now.</p>
