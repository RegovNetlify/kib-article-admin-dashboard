<p>IT is a fact and longheld belief that if you fail to plan, you plan to fail. Perhaps this sounds familiar,
    so why have you not yet taken action and left ground zero? While ground zero does have some
    level of comfort, it gives you a false sense of wellbeing and security – it is time to take charge of your personal finances and retirement fund. To
    have a comfortable and enjoyable retirement, you
    need to start planning now. </p>

<p>This is because there are many things in life that
    are beyond control and you would not want to be
    caught unprepared when things go wrong. Perhaps
    you are not the do-it-yourself (DIY) type with limited
    knowledge of the stock market, mutual funds and
    insurance and number crunching is not your thing. </p>
  
<p>Meanwhile, you have modest savings in deposit
    and you are unsure of what you can do with it to
    generate a higher return. </p>

**<h3>Seek A Financial Planner</h3>**

<p>So who can you go to for help? Who can you trust to confide in and provide you with sound
    advice regarding your finances? In this case, a financial planner is the perfect person for the job.
    A financial planner is someone you can trust to advise you on the management of your personal
    finances. Financial planners are qualified professionals who can advise you on how best to save,
    invest and grow your money. They can help you with specific financial goals, such as preparing to
    make purchases (such as a house) or give you an overall view of your finances and the
    relationships between the different asset classes in your portfolio. Some financial planners specialise in retirement or estate planning while others operate on a range of financial matters.
    However, not all financial planners are experts and the concept of financial planning is still at a
    nascent stage in the country. Over the years, there has been much talk about change and the
    pioneers of the industry must transform from being product driven to advisory based individuals
    who are focused on clients' needs and interests.</p>

**<h3>Take Action And Move Forward</h3>**

<p>Financial planners are not to be confused with remisiers, who help with trading stocks. Neither
    are they accountants who assist in your taxes, insurance agents who offer life insurance policies
    nor are they unit trust consultants who urge you to invest in mutual funds. They are also not will
    writers who assise you in family trusts and estate planning. While you as the individual must
    change your mindset and kick into gear to achieve your financial and life goals, the industry and
    financial planners need to change as well to move forward. They have to move beyond
    meaningless squabbles and trying to achieve the perfect business model. Times are changing
    and the only constant in the continuum is change.</p>

**<h3>Client Centric Service</h3>**

<p>Financial planners must decide how to run their
    business - whether they will choose to be bound by an
    agency structure where commissions to the product
    sellers take precedence or whether they will choose to
    be client-centric, spending quality time with clients to
    understand their financial and life goals before
    recommending the best-suited product rather than
    pushing those that are not applicable to clients’
    objectives. While it is a tough decision to make, it is a
    very necessary one.</p>

<h2>“Financial planners also
    help you focus on financial
    strategies and planning.
    Staying disciplined is
    tough without help and
    procrastination is often the
    cause of many financial
    problems and loss of
    unrealised potential. Hence, it is advisable to
    have a financial planner
    who can help you on your
    journey and stay on track.”</h2>

<p>Many argue that the final decision need not be one or
    the other but to find the balance between clients’
    interests and remuneration of financial planners.
    Whether this becomes the accepted formula in the </p>

<p>industry will rest on clients' shoulders – their preferences will ultimately determine how financial
    planners ply their trade. Product-driven financial planners have long maintained that the effort
    made and time spent with clients to work out a financial plan is too arduous and does not
    commensurate with the income expected. </p>

<p>To them, it is much easier to just do traditional hardsell, which is perhaps why many people are
    apprehensive about engaging a financial planner as they do not want products to be pushed
    down their throats. Meanwhile, proponents of needs-based selling say it is critical for financial
    planners to understand their business from a client's perspective. </p>

<p>The clearer they explain their services to clients, the easier it is for prospective clients to make
    critical decisions to engage them. The consultative approach in need-based selling requires
    financial planners to listen to clients and hold the clients' best interest at heart when
    recommending products</p>

<p>As a potential investor and consumer of financial planning services, you must decide if you would
    like to venture into financial planning independently or seek the services of an expert to help
    manage your money. For some, taking a DIY approach may be a good idea but for others, it is
    not plausible as to be skilled and proficient in personal financial planning takes hours of learning
    and research. </p>

<p>Hence, as you progress in your career and gain greater income, a financial planner can help you
    save ample time in managing your money. Financial planners also help you focus on financial
    strategies and planning. Staying disciplined is tough without help and procrastination is often the
    cause of many financial problems and loss of unrealised potential. Hence, it is advisable to have
    a financial planner who can help you on your journey and stay on track.</p>

<p>With a myriad of things to do when it comes to organising your personal finances such as capital
    accumulation for emergencies, family, education and protection against risks of premature death,
    disabilities, medical and long-term care expenses, unemployment, properties and liability losses
    as well as your general investment portfolio such as retirement planning and provision for
    retirement income, tax planning, estate planning and property management, you can be
    overwhelmed.</p>

<p>These are complex tasks that would be wise to seek the help of a good financial planner.
    Financial planners and clients alike need to undergo a mindset change. You as a client need to
    stop putting off what needs to be done and start planning to secure a more organised financial life
    and be prepared for retirement. </p>

<p>Financial planners, on the other hand, need to throw out old business models and start looking at
    financial planning from a different standpoint, one that does not put commissions first but instead
    has the best interest of clients at heart.</p>

**<h3>When Planning Your Retirement:</h3>**

<ul>
    <li>Account for large purchases you are looking forward to such as a holiday, and
        everyday living expenses</li>
    <li>Aim for a larger sum for your egg rather than underestimating what you will
        require</li>
    <li>Consider creating three different budgets for each phase of retirement to
        account for the variations in spending</li>
    <li>For healthcare expenses, use your own health and family history as a guide</li>
    <li>Keep an emergency fund in retirement in case of unpredictable health problems</li>
</ul>
