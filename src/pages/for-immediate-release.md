**MARC Affirms Investment Manager Rating Of IMR-2 On Kenanga
    Investors Berhad And Kenanga Islamic Investors Berhad</h2>**

![](/img/2018-05-16-marc-rating-2018.png)

<p>MARC has affirmed its investment manager rating (IMR) of IMR-2 on Kenanga Investors Berhad
    (KIB) and on Kenanga Islamic Investors Berhad (KIIB)</p>

<p>KIB is wholly owned by Kenanga Investment Bank Berhad (Kenanga), a key domestic financial
    group, and serves as its parent’s fund management arm by providing fund management services
    on both conventional and Islamic schemes. KIB’s wholly-owned subsidiary KIIB focuses on
    providing only Shariah-compliant investment management services.
    </p>

<p>The IMR rating on KIB reflects the fund management company’s well-established investment
    processes, sound risk management practices and strong operating track record. These factors are
    counterbalanced by its moderate asset size and adequate financial profile. The IMR rating on KIIB
    reflects the significant integration with parent KIB through shared resources and infrastructure.</p>

<p>KIB’s assets under management (AUM) has continued to grow strongly, registering 18% y-o-y in
    2017 and outpacing the domestic industry average growth of 11% y-o-y. Its AUM stood at 8.4 billion
    as at end-2017, accounting for about 1% of total AUM in Malaysia. KIIB, on the other hand, has
    AUM of RM2.2 billion as at end-2017, reflecting the Islamic fund manager’s nascent stage of
    growth. KIB is expected to maintain its strong growth momentum strategy over the medium term
    through a greater focus on retail customers, establishing a private wealth department and an online
    platform to distribute trust funds. MARC is of the view that KIB’s infrastructure, resources and
    expertise of personnel would remain supportive to meet the investment manager’s strategic goals</p>

<p>KIB’s investment team comprises 19 personnel, who collectively have long-standing experience in
    the fund management field. It has in place a disciplined approach towards investment portfolio
    construction, well-supported by comprehensive investment research and reputable information
    systems. Investment portfolios are subject to periodic reviews to assess their performance and, if
    necessary, ensure timely initiatives can be taken to strengthen them. KIB will also continue to
    benefit from sharing common resources with its parent Kenanga.</p>

<p>KIB’s governance and risk management framework remain sound, with clear reporting lines
    between various risk management functions. The recent adoption of the Malaysian Code for
    Institutional Investors will further augment these strengths. Policies and infrastructure to manage
    compliance risk, conflict of interest, counterparty risk and business continuity risk, among others,
    are well supported by information systems. In terms of financial performance, MARC observes that KIB has narrowed its losses to RM2.6 million in 2017 (2016: negative RM5.3 million). The
    improvement was on the back of a 40% y-o-y increase in revenue to RM83.9 million.
