title: Fund Managers Use AI in Their Stock Selection

  IT is intriguing that the asset management industry is able to familiarise
      itself with futuristic buzzwords in the likes of artificial intelligence (AI),
      robotics and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) with ease. Better still, fund
      managers globally no longer perceive AI-related business as hype, but
      rather as a sustainable long-term investment venture. The consensus is such that despite
      still being in an infancy state, AI has the potential to transform the global economy in
      profound ways by disrupting conventional economic sectors ranging from finance to
      healthcare, education and transportation, among others.

<p>IT is intriguing that the asset management industry is able to familiarise
    itself with futuristic buzzwords in the likes of artificial intelligence (AI),
    robotics and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) with ease. Better still, fund
    managers globally no longer perceive AI-related business as hype, but
    rather as a sustainable long-term investment venture. The consensus is such that despite
    still being in an infancy state, AI has the potential to transform the global economy in
    profound ways by disrupting conventional economic sectors ranging from finance to
    healthcare, education and transportation, among others.</p>

**IDC study</h3>**

<p>A recent IDC study commissioned by Microsoft Malaysia reveals that about 7% of the
    GDP last year was derived from digital products and services created directly through the
    use of digital technologies such as mobility, cloud, Internet of Things and AI. Within the
    next four years, Microsoft Malaysia expects to see about 45% of the GDP to be derived
    from digital products and services. At the same time, the information technology giant
    observes that the deployment of AI by organisations across the Asia-Pacific is poised to
    accelerate even further. Very simply, this year and beyond will see more companies
    investing in digital architecture in their quest to become leaner, versatile and better to
    adapt to an unpredictable marketplace.</p>

<p>“The long-anticipated rise of AI, machine learning, robotics and AR/VR technologies will
    finally come together this year, hence further improving business applications,” envisages
    Andy Cocks, chief technology officer of system integrator Dimension Data Asia-Pacific.
    “Enterprise strategy-wise, hybrid IT remains a top priority despite being a tricky one as
    both applications and infrastructure will continue to become more programmable than
    ever.” A recent report published by PricewaterhouseCoopers forecasts AI to contribute
    up to US$15.7 tril (RM61.86 tril) to the global economy come 2030 which is more than
    the current output of China and India combined. Of this, US$6.6 tril is likely to come from 
    increased productivity while US$9.1 tril is expected to come from consumption-side
    effects. A report entitled Fintech Spending and Innovation in Capital Markets by
    consultancy Opimas considered AI “the big winner” as banks, brokers, fund managers
    and other firms poured money into new technologies and data sources. The report came
    with some of the biggest names in finance, including Goldman Sachs, BlackRock and
    Deutsche Bank, are already looking for cheaper and faster ways to transform business
    lines that have until now relied on a human touch. </p>

**Growth opportunities </h3>**

<p>
    Faith in machine-learning technologies expanding exponentially and driving economic
    growth around the world has paved the way for asset management firms to launch
    numerous AI-oriented funds in recent times. Currently, fund managers use various tools to identify companies
    where revenue growth is driven by the development and application of AI. This stockselection process is enhanced by a proprietary AI system which helps to identify
    profitable companies by leveraging AI systems to tap their growth prospects.
    </p>

<p>Typically, the selection process entails:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Research investible universe using an AI-driven screen to identify companies
        where revenues are directly impacted by AI;</li>
    <li>Select the most attractive investment opportunities using fundamental research
        and valuation measures;</li>
    <li>Construct a portfolio that is diversified by sector, region and company size; and</li>
    <li>Monitor risk and performance and manage the particular fund to adapt to changing
        conditions in the global economy and latest industry developments.</li>
  </ul>  

<p>Well-researched investors are aware that the broader technology sector boasts high
    levels of growth at a time when expansion in the overall economy is a little more tepid.
    Against the backdrop of modestly rising interest rates and fuller valuations, Franklin
    Templeton Investments executive vice-president and head of equities Stephen H Dover
    foresees innovative companies with the potential to disrupt existing industries – including
    in emerging markets – to fare particularly well. “We see opportunity not only in disruptive
    technology companies, but also in companies that are using technology to change entire
    industries,” he suggests. “And unlike during past runs in technology stocks, many of
    these companies have actual earnings and cash flows that can support reinvestment in their businesses which in turn makes them less reliant on raising capital in the markets at
    a time when interest rates are climbing.” Together, tech jewels in the likes of Facebook,
    Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google posted average gains of 47.3% last year. Those
    five players alone accounted for 5.2 percentage points of the S&P’s total gain of 23.7%
    (their market share surged from US$2.09 tril at the start of last year to US$3.01 tril by
    end-2017).

<p>Although it cannot be proven that algorithm-driven trading – something which is very
    much aligned to AI technology – was the culprit behind the recent Wall Street sell-off
    which had a contagion effect on global stock markets including Bursa Malaysia, the very
    mention of “algorithm” is an acknowledgement that AI-related technology is itself a
    powerful stock selection tool for index-based funds. Unlike the highly volatile bitcoin and
    its cryptocurrency peers which have in recent times plummeted from a historical high of
    US$19,783.06 on Dec 17 to US$8,828.80 (as of Feb 14), this futuristic technology is here
    to stay. Very much related to bitcoin, however, is the Blockchain technology which was</p>

<p>first created in 2008 and intended to be a framework for the cryptocurrency. Alongside AI,
    these are two major technologies that are catalysing the pace of innovation and
    introducing radical shifts in every industry. With its transformative power, Blockchain is
    widely seen as a game changer that has the potential to lead digitalisation in almost
    every sector – whether asset management, intellectual property management, logistics,
    medical records, supply chains or the sharing economy – that involves value
    transactions. Hiromichi Mizuno, chief investment officer of Japan’s Government Pension
    Investment Fund, the world’s biggest manager of retirement savings, expects AI to be
    able to either replace or enhance the work of asset managers, particularly for short-term
    trading. While he wouldn’t be surprised if many people lose their jobs because AI has
    replaced their routine, he still has faith in human wisdom. “I think the long-term thinking
    and the environmental, social and governance-like non-numerical, non-quantitative
    information will continue to require human interpretation,” he justifies.</p>
