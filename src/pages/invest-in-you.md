The Star (07 July 2021) 

**Kuala Lumpur:** HERE we find ourselves again, in yet another lockdown more than a year after the nation had its first positive case back in 2020. Those still recovering from economic losses brought about by the earlier lockdowns would be impacted further by the current movement control order (MCO). 

Without a strategy to increase savings or to generate passive income, it would be difficult if one were to suddenly displaced by the roll-down effects of the pandemic. During times like these, having a solid financial plan is critical in weathering the worst of the storm. 

Financial planning often seems daunting for most; where does one even start? Some may even believe they don’t have enough assets to perform any sort of planning. The reality of it is, financial planning, or FP for short, can be as complex as balancing a full-fledged portfolio consisting of a wide range of asset classes including stocks, bonds, real estate investment trusts (REITs), unit trust funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and regular fixed deposits. It truly depends on where you are presently, and where you eventually want to be. 

However your financial plan turns out to be, we can all agree that financial security is the most important part of the FP process. Having sufficient savings or insurance coverage in place will provide peace of mind for you and your loved ones. 

Invest in yourself; take the first step towards developing your financial plan by meeting with a licensed professional. At Kenanga Investors Bhd, we appreciate that each investor’s financial journey is a unique as their person. 

Instead of the cookie cutter approach that most other asset and wealth managers adopt despite the various shapes and sizes investors come in, we tailor our financial advice to suit you. 

Our FP approach begins with a review of your current financial circumstances, anticipated changes, future goals, which results in your customised plan. 

We are a subsidiary of the largest independent investment bank in Malaysia and have more than 300 products that include unit trusts, ETFs, private retirement schemes (PRS), insurance, equity broking and treasury solutions from over 18 established industry partners, to ensure that your plan is truly bespoke. 

As an asset and wealth manager, Kenanga Investors is known for its consistent outperformance, validated by its annual success at the Refinitiv Lipper Fund Awards (Malaysia), the Refinitiv Lipper Fund Awards (Global Islamic), Asia Asset Management’s Best of the Best Awards, and the FSMOne Recommended Unit Trust Awards. 

For the fourth consecutive year, we were affirmed an investment manager rating of IMR-2 by Malaysian Rating Corp Bhd, since first rated in 2017, reflecting our well-established investment processes, sound risk management practices and strong operating track record. 

For 2020, the average one-year, three-year, and five-year annualized returns for Kenanga Investors’ top 20 largest unit trust funds outperformed its benchmarks.
