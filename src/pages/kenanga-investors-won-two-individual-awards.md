<p>Kenanga Investors Bhd’s winning streak continued at
    The Edge-Thomson Reuters Lipper Fund Awards
    2016. The Kenanga Growth fund outperformed other
    funds to win the award for Best Equity Malaysia in the
    5 and 10-year categories.</p>

<p>Executive director and CEO Ismitz Matthew De Alwis
    attributes the wins to the fund house’s disciplined
    approach to research and bottom-up stock picking.
    This was underpinned by its value-based investment
    philosophy and the support of dynamic fund
    managers and analysts who are constantly on the
    lookout for market trends and stock ideas.</p>
  
<p>“We have been picking undervalued stocks with
    strong fundamentals and sustainable business
    models. We further intensified our in-house research
    by expanding our ‘radar’ beyond traditional market
    names and sectors in search of value stocks with
    superior earnings growth potential. We believe that as the market continues to evolve, so
    will the way we manage our funds. We need to continue to ‘out-think’ the market and stay
    ahead of the curve,” he says.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge faced by the fund house last year was managing the big swing in
    equity prices associated with various risk events. De Alwis says the ringgit’s 20% plunge
    reflected concerns about the falling oil prices and 1Malaysia Development Bhd’s debt
    issues heightened equity risk premiums as foreigners dumped local stocks.</p>

<p>The team stuck to its bottom-up stock picking to weather the storm. “Throughout the
    year, we looked beyond the macro disturbances and focused on our bottom-up stock picking to deliver consistently positive returns in a falling market. Our flagship fund
    managed to deliver a return of 21% as we successfully picked plenty of benchmark bets
    and under-researched ideas, which gave us alpha performance. These companies are in
    various sectors of the economy, from technology, OEM and plastic packaging to glove
    makers, utilities, e-commerce, consumer and retail,” says De Alwis.</p>

<p>He also says no significant rebalancing was done
    to the funds last year as the key fund managers
    remained intact and the investment style was
    unchanged. “We do not practise active asset
    rebalancing. Our bottom-up stock-picking strategy
    meant that we continued to stay invested as long
    as we found suitable and viable investment candidates that passed our stringent
    research criteria.”</p>

<p>Going forward, the fund house will continue to favour sectors with more resilient earnings
    such as utilities and, to a certain extent, infrastructure and construction, owing to the
    government’s pump-priming. “Exporters may still be good in the first half of the year,
    given the ringgit’s weakness, but we will be ready to look for sectors that will benefit from
    a reversal in trends. These companies, which have costs in the US dollar and revenue in
    the ringgit, will be the beneficiaries,” says De Alwis</p>
