<p>These funds have once again been recognised for its strong performance and resilience during volatile
periods with a good track record of at least three years. Kenanga Investors consistently subscribes to
rigorous stock-picking as well as identifying fundamentally attractive, off-benchmark stocks that may be
undervalued relative to their peers and the overall market valuation, which has led to some underresearched investment opportunities, especially those in the small and mid-cap space.</p>

<p>Kenanga Investors’ Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer, Mr Ismitz Matthew De Alwis said “Both
funds’ performances prove that our long-term bottom-up strategy, which we adapt to the specific needs of
our clients, has consistently led us to achieve success for them”. </p>

<p>As at 30 June 2016, KGF outperformed its benchmark to deliver a total return of 43.68%\* (3 years),
94.38%\* (5 years) and 387.86%\* (10 years) while KSGF delivered a total return of 12.42%\* (3 years),
48.74%\* (5 years) and 245.77%\* (10 years) against the benchmarks despite volatile market conditions. Todate, KGF continues to be ranked No.1 in Equity Malaysia for the 10-year category.
</p>

<p>KGF and KSGF aim to provide clients with long-term capital growth by investing primarily in Malaysian
equities and securities of companies (with a Shariah option) with strong fundamentals that are undervalued
to cater to the diverse needs of our clients.
</p>

<p>Besides winning at the Fundsupermart.com Recommended Unit Trusts Awards which is a prestigious
event organised by FSM to honour top-performing Unit Trust Funds in Malaysia, Kenanga Growth Fund
was also a proud recipient of the Best Performing Equity Malaysia Fund award for the fourth time running
(5 years) and third time running (10 years) at the Lipper Fund Awards 2016 (Malaysia) for the year ended
31 December 2015.</p>
