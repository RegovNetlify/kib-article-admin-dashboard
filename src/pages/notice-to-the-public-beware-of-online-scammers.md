It has been brought to our attention that a third party entity, unrelated to Kenanga Investment Bank Berhad and its subsidiaries (collectively known as “Kenanga Group”), has been using the logo and images belonging to Kenanga Investors Berhad (“Kenanga Investors”) to promote investment schemes not offered by Kenanga Group nor endorsed by or registered with, the Securities Commission Malaysia. Please refer to our official website for the list of investment solutions offered by Kenanga Investors. 

Kenanga Investors wishes to clarify that members of its distribution channels would never request for personal information (e.g. Banking details, NRIC number and/or Passwords) from their clients. All investment payments should only be made to our official bank accounts. No payments whether cash, online transfer or cheques should be made to any Consultants’ or sales representatives’ personal bank accounts. Only individuals registered with the Federation of Investment Managers Malaysia (FIMM) as Consultants are authorised to promote, market and distribute unit trust schemes and private retirement schemes.

Members of the public may conduct online verification checks at FIMM's website [<https://www.fimm.com.my/search/>] to ascertain whether individuals they are dealing with are registered with FIMM as Consultants. Kenanga Investors has reported this matter to the relevant regulators and authorities for further investigation.
