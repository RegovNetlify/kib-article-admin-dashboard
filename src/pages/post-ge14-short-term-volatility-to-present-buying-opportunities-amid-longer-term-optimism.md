<p>The opposition coalition, led by former PM Tun Dr Mahathir, has claimed victory in GE14, winning
    121 (including Warisan) out of the 222 parliamentary seats and ending the 61-year political era
    ruled by BN</p>

<p>The initial market reaction is likely to be negative, as transition to a new government is
    unprecedented for Malaysia and hence perceived as representing a significant market
    uncertainty. With consensus having priced in a ''status quo" outcome and the market having
    outperformed ahead of elections, a knee-jerk sell down on both equities and bonds is likely when
    markets re-opens on Monday, 14th May. Foreign participation in equities and bonds are
    reportedly still at record highs, and the Ringgit was one of the best performing currency YTD.</p>

<p>We are uncertain about how sharp the initial correction may be but if GE12 (when the opposition
    obtained a big win) was any guide, a drop of more than 5% (100 points) is not inconceivable on
    the first trading day. However, we believe the pullback, while sharp, would not last too long as the
    investors view the change of government as an endorsement of progressive and democratic
    movements and that Malaysia is able to withstand a major political shift and potentially come
    back stronger. The soon-to-be-formed cabinet lead by Mahathir is not inexperienced, and is
    expected to consist of former seasoned statesmen with proven ability to govern the country. The
    worries, however, are centred around some of the populist measures in the manifesto including
    the abolishment of GST and reintroduction of fuel subsidies, all of which are interpreted as having
    a negative bearing on the government's fiscal positions. Additionally, pledges have been made to
    review the viability of some mega infrastructure contracts including the HSR and ECRL. In this
    regard, the construction sector looks particularly vulnerable, translating into a slowdown in private
    investment, at least temporarily.
    </p>

<p>However, we are of the view the new government is sensible enough to be steadfast in restoring
    investor confidence in the coming days. The formation of a credible cabinet with the right
    credentials in itself may serve as a catalyst, whilst elaboration of further plans, especially on
    economic issues, are further impetus.
    </p>

<p>At the point of writing, the incoming government has issued its first 100 days fiscal plans to
    address wide spread concerns on fiscal deficit and debt levels. Lending further support to our
    belief that the sell-down could prove short-lived are regional occurrences where negative market
    reactions associated with events like the Thai military coup, Brexit, Donald Trump winning the US
    presidency were short in nature with markets subsequently rebounding and exceeding previous
    highs.
    </p>

<p>Beyond the near-term political focus, the country remains an attractive investment destination
    given that the economy is growing at one of the fastest pace in recent years and corporate
    earnings are set to rebound after 3 years of decline. Whilst the Ringgit may temporarily soften, it
    could resume its strength given the prospects of stronger growth and inbound investment.
    Domestic liquidity remains abundant whilst GLC reform stories could gather further momentum
    post the installation of the new government.</p>

<p>In terms of portfolio strategy, we intend to take advantage of the market weakness to bottom fish
    on stocks which remain fundamentally attractive regardless of the change in government. These
    include selective stocks in banking, oil and gas (given the recovery in oil price), consumer
    discretionary (prime beneficiary of populist measures like wage hike and GST abolishment) and
    exporters like tech, EMS players and glove manufacturers (beneficiary of renewed currency
    weakness). We are reviewing our positions on the contractors but would largely be biased
    towards top-slicing only the fundamentally weaker counters. Overall, our cash reserves of
    between 15-20% would enable us to bottom fish on our conviction ideas, whilst partially closing
    our underweight positions on the index heavyweights amidst the sell down. Once the political
    dust has settled, we believe that the strong fundamentals and ‘democratic dividend’ would prevail
    to re-rate the market towards a stronger 2H.
