### Review And Evaluate

In times of panic, we easily stumble in our rush to avoid losses. Though it is hard to be objective when surrounded by a herd mentality, it is absolutely necessary. Retirement savings are often referred to as nests, but I liken it more to a ship. By objectively reviewing your portfolio, you can ensure that your retirement ship is well fuelled, travelling on course, with leaks sealed, and its growing cargo protected.

Even if strong winds emerge, you can adjust your sails to your advantage. This step also prevents you from using your savings immediately to supplement everyday expenses. It forces you to determine your cash position and look for ways to budget. If you must access your savings, calculate how much you can take without affecting your long-term goal. When you can return the amount withdrawn. Evaluate your current allocation and your risk tolerance before making a move. A diversified portfolio limits your exposure to a single type of investment, reducing volatility over time.

### Reduce Debt

Avoid additional debt even if you seem to be in a safe position. Recent events have shown that one should expect nothing and anticipate everything. Look at existing loans and prioritise repayments systematically. Often, debt impedes saving as interest can accumulate rapidly, limiting your ability to devote income to savings or investments. If you are still in your 30s or 40s, focus on paring down your debt while leaving saving on the backburner. Once that is done, make saving a priority again.

### Health Is Wealth

A person’s ability to dock at their retirement harbour also depends on whether they have access to healthcare later on. Ensure that your needs are protected against rising healthcare costs with sufficient medical coverage. Presently, though you may be covered by your employer’s insurance, it will cease once you are unemployed. Therefore, purchasing your own medical plan offers an additional layer of security. As we enter the third quarter of the year, economic data is showing signs of recovery thanks to local fiscal support and liquidity programmes. However, the threat of new infections remains, which may mean persisting volatility.

The immediate focus for investors is to ensure their cash flow and savings remain intact. At this juncture, they need to remain fixed on these goals to survive these waves of turmoil. – By Ismitz Matthew De Alwis, executive director and chief executive officer of Kenanga Investors Berhad
