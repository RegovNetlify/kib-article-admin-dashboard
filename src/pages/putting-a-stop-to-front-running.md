<p>FRONT–running – the practice of buying or selling a security using advance knowledge of
    pending orders to wrongfully benefit from the trade – has become difficult to trace these days.
    This is especially so with stock exchanges all over the world seeing high frequency trades and direct market access technology. Imagine how a
    milisecond advantage in the queue order can allow
    investors with privileged information to reap handsome
    profits from their trading activities. In essence, such
    discreet practice is often associated with dealer
    representatives handling accounts of several big
    institutions/ retail clients.</p>

<p>Front-running made headlines recently when it was
    rumoured that the drastic slide in four iliquid stocks –
    United U-Li Corp Bhd, SAM Engineering & Equipment
    (M) Bhd, SLP Resources Bhd and SCGM Bhd – in midAugust could be linked to the change of personnel at
    RHB Asset Management Sdn Bhd. </p>
  
<p>However, the speculation was put to rest by Datuk
    Khairussaleh Ramli, the group managing director of
    RHB Banking Group, who denied that the group’s asset
    arm was involved in any selldown of those counters</p>

<p>Coincidentally, Singapore’s financial regulator charged
    three bankers on Aug 26 with front-running stocks in
    trading incidents dating back to before the financial crisis of 2008 – 2009. This marks the first criminally-pursued case of its sort in the city-state.</p>

<p>Leong Chee Wai and Toh Chew Leong – both dealers with First State Investments Singapore –
    and Simon E Seck Peng, a dealer’s representative at UOB Kay Hian, were charged with frontrunning or trading on information not yet available to the bank’s clients.</p>

<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore has accused the trio of having traded based on information
    they were privy to 49 Singapore-listed securities, including Allgreen Properties, CapitaLand, City
    Developments, DBS Group and Keppel Corp, as well as 51 listed in Australia, Taiwan, Malaysia
    and Hong Kong.</p>

**Stringent Guidelines</h3>**

<p>A check with Kenanga Investors Bhd (KIB) reveals that investment decisions made by the
    company’s investment team are guided by stringent guidelines comprising both regulatory and
    internal policies.</p>

<p>“Besides fulfilling the limits and restrictions under the guidelines which apply only on a per fund
    basis, we also have additional prudential internal limits and restrictions on a group-of-funds basis
    or firm-wide basis,” KIB’s CEO/executive director Ismitz Matthew De Alwis tells FocusM. We are
    fully guided by our investment policy, processes and risk management.” </p>

<p>On the fund level, De Alwis says informaiton could be obtained through the respective
    prospectuses which generally prescribe the percentage of maximum holding versus the net asset
    value of the fund. Moreover, there are also internal benchmarks imposed on a firm-wide level.</p>

<p>“To provide an insight into all stocks purchased by the fund managers must be within our
    investment universe and are segregated into Core One, Two and Three,” he rationalises. “The
    maximum holding for each stock allowed for each portfolio is 5%, 3% and 2% respectively of the
    company’s total share base.” Additionally, the stocks must be supported with research reports, indepth analysis and with strong fundamentals.</p>

<p>For an employee’s personal trading account, De Alwis says KIB adheres to strict monitoring
    oversight. The company’s compliance unit conducts a yearly review on each staff and fund manager’s trading activities directly with Bursa Malaysia against their declaration and their
    nominees’ holdings</p>

<p>“This is to ensure that not only our investment team’s activities are monitored but also that of all
    the firm’s employees,” justifies De Alwis. “Furthermore, this is to ensure there is no conflict with
    our clients’ best interests.”</p>

<p>The next – and final – “line of defence” is the company’s investment risk analytics units. This
    independent unit (residing out of the investment division) also monitors investments made by its
    fund managers per portfolio to assess the risks taken by those fund managers. </p>

**Punitive Action</h3>**

<p>Given that it is diffuclt to nail unscrupulous fund managers who are involved in front-running,
    enforcement agencies should endeavour to prosecute cases as soon as there is sufficient
    evidence to act on them, according to the Minority Shareholder Watchdog Group CEO Rita
    Benoy Bushon.</p>

<p>“Swift action by the enforcement agencies would promote and instill investors’ confidence in the
    capital market while sending a clear message that nobody can escape the long arm of the law if
    they have comitted offences,” she tells FocusM. “This would thus act as a deterrent to both
    insiders and other market players.”</p>

<p>If gone unchecked, Bushon expresses concern that front-running would undermine both
    investors’ confidence and efforts to maintain fair play and orderly market. “It would affect, not only
    the interest of the minority/retail investors, but all stakeholders in the capital market as well,” she
    asserts.</p>

<p>Insider trading is an offence under Section 188(2) of the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007,
    punishable under Section 188(4) with imprisonment term not exceeding 10 years and a fine of not
    less than RM1 mil.</p>

**Onus On Market Regulators</h3>**

<p>Under the Singapore Securities and Futures Act, insider trading carries a fine not exceeding
    S$250,000 (RM757, 899) or imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years or both. “In our
    opinion, the punishment accorded under the Malaysian law for offenders is considered punitive,”
    asserts Bushon. “However, the process of the law to ensure the culprits are taken to task is long..
    The longer the regulators take to prosecute these offenders would indirectly impact on the
    success rate, which is dependent on the availability of evidence and witnesses who are willing to
    testify in such cases.”</p>

<p>Malaysian Investors’ Association president Datin Ho Choy Meng reckons that it does not entail a
    delicate task to detect front-running. At the simplest level, Bursa Malaysia should be able to
    detect such nefarious activities manifested through the numerous instances of unusual market
    activity query issuance, according to her. </p>

<p>“For front-running, the offenders make use of their knowledge of client orders and intersperse
    them with their own trade to profit,” Ho tells FocusM. “There will be a trail of sequences of trades
    linking the two or more related trade accounts.”</p>

<p>For preventive measures, Bursa Malaysia should put in place supervisory rules whereby trading
    participants are required to maintain a proper system to supervise the activities of each registered
    representative, agents and other personnel. This is reasonably designed to achieve compliance
    with the Rule of the Capital Markets & Services Act.</p>

<p>“Indeed, the regulatory authorities have already put in place some – though not an exhaustive list
    – of well-established rules and regulations, specifically to deal with market misconduct,” Ho points
    out. “But the enforcers must be vigilant at all times, ready to haul the suspects up and prosecute
    them based on the evidence gathered without fear or favour.”</p>

<h2>Bursa Shows It Means Business</h2>

<p>IF Aug 26 marks the maiden legal pursuit of
    front-running case by the Monetary Authority of
    Singapore, such unethical business conduct
    has been detected much earlier in Malaysia.</p>

<p>On June 5, 2014, Bursa Malaysia Securities
    Bhd publicly reprimanded, fined and ordered to
    strike off two former dealer’s representatives
    (DRs) for conduct that involved front-running
    activities, pre-arranged/coordinated trades,
    abuses of clients’ trade information and the
    undertaking of unauthorised trades in a client’s
    account.</p>

<p>Sazail Shaharudin, a salaried DR of
    AmInvestment Bank Bhd was publicly
    reprimanded, fined RM50,000 and ordered to
    be struck off the register of Bursa Malaysia
    Securities. </p>

<p>Wong Lup Mun @ Wong Cheng Hoh, a
    commissioned DR of Kenanga Investment
    Bank Bhd, was fined RM55,000 aside from
    being publicly reprimanded and ordered to be
    struck off the register of Bursa Malaysia
    Securities.</p>

<p>The Securities Commission (SC) in its
    Guidelines on Market Conduct and Business
    Practices for Stockbroking Companies and
    Licensed Representatives (revised on Nov 20,
    2014) has listed front-running as one of the 13
    examples of market abuses and unethical
    business conduct</p>

<p>The regulator describes front-running as
    follows: “Dealer’s representatives handling
    accounts of several big institutions/retail
    customers executed trades for their individual
    customers or accounts of related persons prior
    to the execution of trades of the big
    institutions/retail customers with the view to
    front-run and make quick profits.”</p>

<p>Other forms of market abuses and unethical
    business conduct identified by the SC are (i)
    action-based manipulation; (ii) trade-based
    manipulation; (iii) “painting the tape”; (iv)
    unethical trades; (v) “roll-over”; (vi) third party
    payment; (vii) “marking the close”; (viii) conflicts
    (a person with knowledge of a favourable or
    unfavourable research report purchases or
    sells securities in advance of the report being
    released); (ix) “scalping”; (x) “spoofing”; (xi)
    “pump and dump”, and (xii) “trash and cash”.</p>
