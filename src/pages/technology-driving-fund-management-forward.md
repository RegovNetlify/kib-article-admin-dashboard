<p>The digital revolution and fintech wave that are sweeping the investment landscape
    have turned the global asset management industry on its head. This can be seen in the
    rise of robo-advisory platforms, artificial intelligence-based processes and big data
    analysis.</p>

<p>Asset management companies in the country are responding to these trends and are
    exploring or looking to incorporate such technologies in their operations. The aim of
    these innovations is to enhance the customer experience, widen distribution channels,
    lower operation costs and improve investment returns.</p>

<p>Chan Ai Mei, chief marketing and distribution officer at Affin Hwang Asset Management
    Bhd, says technology and innovation play a vital role in determining the success of asset
    management firms, especially when it comes to reaching out to the younger generation.
    "It is necessary to appeal to a new generation of investors who are more digitally savvy.
    Asset managers globally are often challenged when it comes to luring millennial
    investors, who tend to be always online or connected and socially conscious but also
    often fickle and price-sensitive," she adds.

<p>"If industry players failed to ride this trend, asset managers would be limiting themselves
    to the same subset of investors and fail to draw in this new group of investors who desire
    more convenience and automation, as well as proximity and engagement with their asset
    managers." Technology's role in the financial services industry will be even more critical
    as it is an intangible market. So, there is a possibility of the entire value chain being
    digitalised, says Kenanga Investors Bhd CEO Ismitz Matthew De Alwis. "We see
    opportunities for this in client management, product innovations and expansion of
    distribution networks, among others. However, we should not completely write off the
    human aspect of the business," he adds. "Due to the nature of the products, the
    consumer may not have the expertise or time to fully understand a particular product
    before taking it up. There are still needs and, to a certain degree, some hand-holding
    from a financial consultant to help customers understand the products before they can be
    fully on-boarded."

<p>PMB Investment Bhd CEO Najmi Mohamed says no industry can escape the digital
    disruption. "Today's clients expect a new kind of experience that is more informed, personalised and transparent. They want information more quickly than ever before," he
    adds. "We firmly believe that for PMB to grow, we need to transform our business and
    have a clear and coherent investment strategy. In fact, starting this year, we are
    embarking on replacing our existing system with a new one that can offer integrated, truly
    end-to-end solutions for our clients. It will also cover the front-end, back-end, customercentric call centres, customer websites and mobile applications, among others." Pheim
    Asset Management Sdn Bhd chief strategist and industry veteran Dr Tan Chong Koay
    says asset management firms that are slow to adopt new technologies will lose out in the
    long term. "The acceleration of new and disruptive technologies will bring both
    opportunities and threats to the fund managers of the future. These technologies could
    snatch away precious market share from fund managers who do not keep pace with the
    digital advancements," he adds.</p>

<p>"Asset management firms should focus on innovations that fully embrace advanced
    technologies such as AI, machine learning and big data analytics, especially in their
    investment management and distribution processes, to gain a competitive edge in the
    marketplace." Tan is on the lookout for advanced technologies to "improve our
    investment decision-making, especially in reading the market right, so as to outperform
    \[the market] and benefit our investors".

**What Firms Are Doing Right Now**</h3>

<p>AI and big data analysis are two areas that asset management companies are exploring.
    These technologies enable fund managers to collect data from various sources, analyse
    the data, predict market movements and quickly identify investment opportunities in the
    market. PMB's Najmi says many fund managers are going beyond traditional stockpicking methods and are using advanced analytical techniques and alternative data sets
    to stay ahead of the curve. "Investment managers are using innovative technologies,
    such as AI and other advanced analytical techniques, to improve their traditional
    investment processes. This is not only for decision-making but also to find better ways to
    execute trades. The number and type of alternative data sets seem to increase on a daily
    basis," he adds.</p>

<p>"Fund managers who seek to push the utilisation of different technologies, analytical
    capabilities and alternative data sources to generate alpha may be positioned for
    sustainable growth." Kenanga's De Alwis is also a proponent of AI and big data analytics.
    He says the firm has already incorporated technological elements into its investment
    processes. "For instance, our investment risk analytics team is guided by a risk analytics
    digital platform. The platform collects data concerning benchmarks for risk monitoring
    and reporting. "It grants the team access to information such as the Sharpe ratio, Sortino
    ratio, tracking error, information ratio and Jensen's Alpha to measure performance risk.
    This has allowed us to derive a more accurate, transparent and holistic valuation. IT also
    allows us to have lower portfolio volatility exposure."</p>

<p>The fund house made its foray into AI last year when it launched Kenanga Global MultiAsset Fund. It is the first Malaysian fund to leverage AI capabilities to identify short-term
    profit opportunities. This is done by predicting the relationship between pricing and
    volume data. The fund also constructs its portfolio with a focus on capital preservation by
    utilising AI forecasting capabilities.</p>

<p>Some asset management firms are using technology to enhance the service quality of
    their existing channels, such as their agency force. Some of them have established
    online portals to provide customers with direct access to key information on their
    investment portfolios. This allows investors to track their investments at any time and
    evaluate the quality of advice they receive from unit trust agents. "Asset management
    companies will have to invest more in the online platform to allow potential investors to
    buy products \[directly] from them," says Wong Mien, CEO of TA Investment Management
    Bhd.</p>

<p>Public Mutual Bhd CEO Yeoh Kim Hong says its agents are provided with computer
    programmes and mobile applications to allow them to access products, markets and
    investor information faster. Meanwhile, investors can use its electronic platform to keep
    track of products and investment information as well as make product comparisons.
    According to CEO Raymond Tang, Eastspring Investments Bhd has launched an
    "investors and agents portal" that provides them with direct access to key investment
    information. PMB, on the other hand, is developing a "digital dashboard" to improve the
    quality of its unit trust agents. "This is done by enhancing the advisory process with
    notifications and alerts and providing a holistic view of each customer's account.</p>

<p>The goal is to improve the quality of adviser-customer relationships by reducing the time
    it takes when it comes to daily processing activities," says Najmi, who is planning to take
    the digitalisation plan further by establishing a "direct investment purchase channel via
    web, mobile and email". Asset management companies are also making sure that their
    intermediaries, such as unit trust agents, are able to play a more important advisory role
    in the near future. Agents can no longer see themselves as salespeople selling unit trusts
    as a product; say the leaders of local asset management firms. "They need to focus more
    on the role that technology cannot play, namely building better personal relationships
    with clients and offering holistic financial planning solutions," says PMB's Najmi. Danny
    Wong, CEO of Areca Capital Sdn Bhd, says the firm is moving towards providing clients
    with holistic financial planning services. "We obtained our financial planning licence from
    the Securities Commission Malaysia last year."</p>

<p>On the technological front, there has been a proliferation of robo-advisory platforms that
    offer investors simple financial advice and low-cost investment solutions. If the developed
    markets are an indicator of where emerging markets such as Malaysia are heading, the
    robo-advisory space is where local asset management firms want to be.</p>

<p>Betterment, one of the largest robo-advisory platforms in the US, which started
    operations in 2008, says it saw 320,000 customers last year while its assets under
    management (AUM) grew to US$12.5 billion. In 2010, it had only 900 customers and
    US$3.3 million under management. While Betterment's AUM is smaller than those of
    traditional asset management firms in the US, it shows the platform's huge potential and
    the challenge it could pose to some incumbents. However, fund management experts
    believe that robo-advisory platforms will not disrupt the local market anytime soon. The
    key reason is that a large number of investors, especially those from the older
    generation, still rely on unit trust agents to make their investment decisions. Local
    investors, particularly the emerging affluent and high-net-worth individuals, still
    appreciate the human touch, says Areca's Wong.</p>

<p>Investor awareness of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) remains low. As many are not
    familiar with how such funds work, it is unlikely that they will put their money in roboadvisory platforms, which mainly invest in ETFs. The current distribution channel, which
    is to sell unit trust products through agents, will continue to prevail, says Affin Hwang's
    Chan. "The advances in technology will complement and supplement service delivery
    \[rather than replace it]. It will enhance the client experience and empower investors by
    providing them with convenience and information at their fingertips," she adds.</p>

<p>The passive investing strategy, which has gained a lot of traction recently, is another
    area posing challenges to traditional asset management firms that offer actively managed
    funds. According to Deutsche Bank and Bloomberg, the global ETF industry hit
    US$413.1 trillion at the end of last year, compared with US$205.6 trillion 15 years ago.
    According to market and consumer data provider Statista, the number of ETFs worldwide
    reached 4,779 last year from only 276 in 2003. "ETFs have increased their presence in
    the equity markets. According to Bloomberg, a little more than a third of all assets in the
    US are now in passive funds, up from about one-fifth a decade ago," says Pheim's Tan.</p>

**Mixed Response To ETFs Locally</h3>**

<p>"Flowmageddon" was the term used by US investment research and management firm
    Morningstar to describe the huge amount of money flowing into the exchange-traded fund (ETF)
    space in August 2016. According to Deutsche Bank and Bloomberg, the total assets managed
    by ETFs globally reached USS3 trillion for the first time ever that year. By end-2016, the figure
    had hit USS3.51 trillion. Last year, it was more than USS4 trillion. The fund flows of ETFs
    became so big that they were partly blamed for the correction in the US stock markets in
    February. This prompted newly appointed US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell to
    state that the funds were not the main contributor to the correction. Despite the kind of traction
    ETFs have globally, especially in the developed markets, many asset management firms are
    hesitant to launch these funds in Malaysia, saying that the awareness of these types of
    products is still low in the country. However, some of them are certain that ETFs will eventually
    take off in the future. Those that have launched or shown interest in offering ETFs include Affin
    Hwang Asset Management Bhd, PMB Investment Bhd, Pheim Asset Management Sdn Bhd and
    Kenanga Investors Bhd.</p>

<p>Affin Hwang's chief marketingand distribution officer Chan Ai Mei says the fund house launched
    its first ETF - the TradePlus Shariah Gold Tracker ETF — in December last year. "We believe
    ETFs are steadily gaining traction despite the significant ground to cover before we catch up
    with developed markets such as the US," For now, the company is focusing on building the size
    of its gold ETF so that it can achieve better economies of scale which, in turn, will lower the
    annual management fee imposed on ETF investors. PMB Investment CEO Najmi Mohamed
    plans to launch an ETF in the future. He says these funds have seen significant inflows globally
    in recent years and they will eventually make their way to Malaysia, The passive investing
    strategy is also expected to be more popular, along with the financial technology (fintech) trend,
    which will give retail investors greater ability and flexibility to invest on their own. Kenanga
    Investors CEO Ismitz Matthew De Alwis says while the fund house does not have a hard target
    for new ETF products, it is exploring the various opportunities in the space, such as offering
    ETFs through a digital investment platform (also known as a robo-advisory platform), "We are
    currently seeking opportunities to potentially team up with other established ETF fund managers
    and stakeholders to jointly launch new ETF products locally." Public Mutual Bhd, Eastspring
    Investments Bhd, Areca Capital Sdn Bhd and TA Investment Management Bhd have no plans
    to launch ETFs in the near future.</p>
