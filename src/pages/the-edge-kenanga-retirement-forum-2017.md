      starting a family – lasts an average of 25 years. So why should retirement be any different?” said De Alwis.
      Planning well is even more pertinent today, with life expectancy rates increasing and birth rates dropping.

<h2>Perception Of Retirement Must Be Changed</h2>



<p>Malaysians must alter their mindset of what retirement is and view it as a chapter instead of an endpoint
    so that they can plan better for what is to come. According to Kenanga Investors Bhd CEO Ismitz Matthew
    De Alwis, most people go through their working years thinking of retirement as the final destination. This
    perception is one of the main reasons many people fail to plan and sustain their life savings in their
    retirement years, he said at The Edge-Kenanga Retirement Forum 2017. “But the truth is, retirement is
    another phase of life. If you really observe, every phase of life – from childhood to young adulthood, to
    starting a family – lasts an average of 25 years. So why should retirement be any different?” said De Alwis.

<p>Malaysia also faces the prospect of a growing ageing population and workforce, De Alwis told participants
    during his presentation on why retirement was going to be more challenging than before. “Just look at our
    neighbours across the Causeway. People in their sixties and seventies are working at fast-food joints as
    cleaners and servers. Why do they need to continue working at an age when they should be putting up
    their feet and relaxing?” he said.</p>

<p>“A friend recently argued that Singapore is rich enough to provide the elderly with a social safety net
    similar to some Scandinavian countries. But what many people fail to grasp is that in those countries, their
    citizens are taxed more than 50% \[so that aged care services, for example, can be rolled out]. Can such a
    high tax regime be imposed in Singapore, or even Malaysia for that matter?” According to the Department
    of Statistics, Malaysia is expected to experience population ageing by 2020, where the percentage of
    those aged 65 years and above reaches 7.2%. “There is new research that says if you live beyond 72, you
    are most probably going to live past 80. That is 20-odd years of life after retirement. So, like every other
    phase in life, retirement is simply a milestone on this journey,” said De Alwis. </p>

<p>In February, the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) disclosed that two-thirds of its members aged 54 had
    RM50,000 or less in their accounts as at 2015. This data is one of the reasons the EPF is considered to be
    “one of the least adequate” in the Allianz Retirement Income Adequacy Indicator – a ranking of retirement
    income adequacy of pensions provided by 49 countries across the globe. Going by this data, at the official
    retirement age of 60, most Malaysians may find themselves with no assets and roughly 20 more years to
    live.</p>

<p>Despite numerous research and statistics that set alarm bells ringing, most Malaysians are not prepared to
    retire, taking into consideration the rising cost of healthcare, increasing inflation and longevity risks. “By
    2040, 19.8% of the population will be made up of senior citizens. Besides living longer, we have to worry
    about inflation. Our headline inflation is at 3.6%, but there are categories of inflation, such as education
    and healthcare expenses, to consider,” said De Alwis. “Gone are the days when people had children early
    in life. My children will only be in college when I am in my late fifties and early sixties. So, by the time we
    retire, our children will still be in school.</p>

<p>“We will not only have to pay for their education but also provide \[financial] help after they graduate and
    start working. For instance, they will need a car or help with the down payment for a property of their own.
    If your parents are dependent on you, that is another thing to think about. It is a sandwich environment
    because we not only have to care for our children but also our elderly parents. So, if you are going to put
    your money in fixed deposits, it will be another challenge as interest rates are rather low. That is why we
    need to look for investments that offer returns beyond the inflation rate.”</p>

<p>Given the circumstances, it is pertinent for those just starting work or in their mid-career journey to think
    about their goals and responsibilities and start saving accordingly, said De Alwis. “How much do you need
    to save? According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, on average, one
    should save at least 33% of their income while working. And by the time they reach retirement, Malaysians
    should look at building a nest egg that is 12 to 14 times larger than their last drawn annual salary.”</p>

<p>The Private Retirement Scheme (PRS) is another savings option to consider, said De Alwis. The scheme
    offers a maximum tax relief of RM3,000 to contributors. Under Budget 2017, RM165 million was allocated
    to the PRS Youth Scheme (for those aged 20 to 30), where the government will give a one-off RM1,000 in
    PRS accounts. The incentive was previously RM500.</p>
