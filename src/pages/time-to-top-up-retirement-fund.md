<p>IF YOU have been putting aside one-third of your salary into a retirement fund, now is the right time to top
    up your unit premiums, said Private Pension Administrator (PPA) chief executive officer Husaini Hussin.</p>
  
<p>This is because as people progress in their careers, there will be salary increases and performance
    bonuses. With the higher income comes a change in lifestyle and considerations must be made on ways
    to cope with expenses after retirement.</p>

<p>Speaking on the “Top Up Your Life” campaign, which aims to help Malaysians gain better awareness on
    how to better prepare for their retirement years, Husaini said the first thing people do when they get a raise
    is to think of how to spend the money. Going for holidays, a new car and luxuries are some of the typical
    indulgences.</p>

<p>“What about reviewing your monthly retirement savings?</p>

<p>“Remember, the initial sum that you started with as an executive should not remain the same now that you
    are in middle management,” said Husaini. Latching on the common theme of top-up cards to enable people to go further and enjoy better benefits, the campaign is focused on encouraging members to top-up
    their retirement savings by at least 10%. This must be done regularly and not as and when it is convenient,
    said Husaini. Based on feedback from members, Husaini said some prefer to put their money in when
    units are cheaper.</p>

<p>However, this also means they are not setting aside money regularly for retirement savings.</p>

<p>Husaini said the best way to gain optimum results is t o follow a regular plan. Members will not only enjoy
    the reward of compounded interest, but over time, they would have optimised on the dollar-cost averaging
    of unit prices.</p>

<p>To learn more, the “Top Up Your Life” campaign will feature a series of talks on July 16, Aug 13 and Oct 7
    at Cybertorium in Menara Star, Petaling Jaya, from 9am to noon. Participants aged between 20 and 30 are
    strongly encouraged to attend as well as those in their pre-and post-retirement years</p>

<p>The session will reveal how individuals from different categories can plan their finances to optimise on
    their retirement savings as well as manage existing retirement funds. Participants will also stand a chance
    to receive a RM500 contribution for the private retirement scheme (PRS) on the day of the talk.</p>

<p>In line with the campaign is the online Top Up Treats which will reward the 38th, 76th, 114th and 152nd
    transactions with RM100 worth of PRS units.</p>

<p>The event is organised by Star Media Group and brought to you by Private Pension Administrator
    Malaysia, Affin Hwang Asset Management Berhad, Kenanga Investors Berhad and CIMB Principal Asset
    Management Berhad. Those interested can register at http://sites.thestar.com.my/talk/retirement to book a
