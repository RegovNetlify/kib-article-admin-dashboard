<p>Many of the Private Retirement Scheme funds have seen mediocre returns over the years,
    but a number of them have performed well in the past 12 months. Industry players share
    their views on the voluntary pension scheme.</p>
  
<p>THE performance of the funds under the Private Retirement Scheme (PRS), which was established almost
    five years ago, has been lacklustre at best. The poor to negative returns of many of these funds may have
    discouraged individuals from participating in the scheme, say some industry observers.</p>

<p>Husaini Hussin, who recently took the helm at the Private Pension Administrator Malaysia (PPA),
    acknowledges the poor performance of these funds but says the members need to take a long-term view.
    “Members need to consider how the fund will grow in the future, in the long run, and not so much the
    fund’s immediate gains,” says the CEO. “We cannot comment on the overall performance. That is now
    how we do the assessment. Some funds are doing well, some could be better. But hopefully, in the long,
    run, when members make their monthly contributions, they will be able to take advantage of the dollar-cost
    averaging because in the long term, the market tends to offer good returns.” </p>

<p>According to Morningstar’s monthly PRS performance report, more than one-third (24) of the 56 PRS
    funds saw a cumulative return of less than 3% over a one-year period ended Jan 31 – lower than local
    fixed deposit rates. Over a two-year period, 20 funds saw cumulative return of less than 3%. Of these
    funds, 11 recorded negative returns. Over a three-year year period, 22 funds registered returns of less
    than 3%. Husaini points out that there are different types of funds, under the PRS, catering for different
    investment needs and risk appetites. Hence, the returns are variable. “They have different investment objectives, cater for different risk appetites, have different risk exposure and have different underlying
    assets,” he says</p>

<p>“All eight fund providers are under the
    purview of the Securities Commission
    Malaysia (SC). And yes, we should
    like competitive returns across the
    bpard. But we should also remember
    that PRS is about choice. So, if you
    do not like the fund you have invested
    in, you can switch providers. This
    option is available to members. “The
    PRS is a vehicle to help you save
    more for your retirement. Using the
    information you get on the website
    and from the distributors, you can
    decide which funds suit you best
    based on your risk appetite and long-time objectives.” It is worth noting that invesments in funds such as AmanahSaham Nasional Bhd (ASNB)
    do not incur sales or annual management fees – unlike PRS funds, which can impose an upfront sales
    charge and annual management fee of up to 3%. “Yes, you can invest money in ASNB or pilgrimage fund
    Lembaga Tabung Haji, in addition to the Employees Provident Fund (EPF). But one thing that is truly
    different in the specifics is that the PRS is designed to protect your nest egg for retirement,” says Husaini.</p>

<p>“You may withdraw up to 30% of your money on annual basis. But you must keep 70% in your account
    until you reach the age of 55. “As the government is trying to grow the segment to complement EPF
    contributions, it has given individuals incentives such as a tax relief for the contributions up to RM3,000.
    Employers can claim up to 90% in corporate tax relief. These incentives are not available with any other
    savings or investment plans.” The PPA is the central administrator of the PRS, approved by the SC to
    oversee and promote the growth of the industry, create general awareness and educate the public on the
    scheme as well as protect members’ interests. Affin Hwang Asset Management Bhd chief marketing
    distribution officer Chan Ai Mei says the benefit of investing in PRS funds is that while the more aggressive
    ones are targeted at growth, all providers are mandated by the SC to ensure that capital preservation</p>

<p>remains the key investment strategy as the investments are essentially retirement savings. “We encourage
    individuals to save more and not rely on a publicly managed retirement scheme due to the increase in life
    expectancy, inflation, cost of living and healthcare costs,” she says.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Chan reminds contributors that unlike the EPF, the PRS
    lacks a capital or minimum return guarantee. “All investments carry some
    sort of risk and contributions to the PRS funds are not excluded. Thus, it is
    important that contributors understand the risks involved, have basic
    knowledge of investments and engage a provider that understand the risks
    involved, have basic knowledge of investments and engage a provider that
    understands their needs and requirements. In short, choose wisely and
    invest regularly,” she says. Principal Financial Group Asia chairman Rex
    Auyeung says and pension system needs time to grow, especially a
    voluntary scheme such as the PRS, for it to complement the existing
    retirement structure. He points out that the EPF has taken more than 60 to
    become what it is today. “The EPF has a large presence in the local equity
    market. So, when it sneezes, everyone is bound to catch a cold. I would
    rather have another system like the PRS, despite its size today. We need
    to look at it long term and let the funds grow,” he says on the sidelines of
    the SC’s International Fund Forum 2017, which was held earlier this year.
    Auyeung has been instrumental in Principal Financial Group’s expansion In Asia over the last four decades. In 1995, the group partnered CIMB Group’s asset management arm to
    form CIMB-Principal Asset Management Bhd, which has a presence in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia
    and Thailand. </p>

**Supplementing Retirement Savings</h3>**

<p>The PRS is a defined contribution pension scheme. It allows employees, employers and the self-employed
    to voluntarily contribute to an investment vehicle for the purpose of building up their nest egg for
    retirement. The scheme was launched in July 2012 to encourage pro-active savings. The move was aimed
    at supplementing employees’ statutory contributions to the EPF. The PRS was set up because most
    Malaysians do not have enough savings to meet their retirement needs due to the increasing life
    expectancy and the rising cost of living.</p>

<p>“PRS is meant to complement the exisitng mandatory
    provisions. The scheme seeks to enhance the choices
    available to Malaysians to voluntarily supplement their
    retirement savings under a well-strucured and regulated
    environment,” says RHB Asset Management Sdn Bhd
    CEO Ho Seng Yee. “The availability of the PRS has made
    it convenient for the public to save for retirement according
    to their comfort levels and affordability in a disciplined way
    through regular and consistent contributions to the
    scheme. With a national focus on more voluntary savings, the PRS is a platform to kick-start this initiative by providing a universal, flexible and tailored solution to the
    individuals.” Auyeung says an alternative retirement planning system helps to prop up the capital markets
    as regular inflows stabilise fluctuations. “On the fixed income side, this kind of regular savings for
    retirement will create a bond market, which will help the development of the overall capital markets
    because we have to do assets liability matching. So, we have to make sure we are invested for the long
    term to match the long-term commitments we have made. From an equities and fixed-income perspective,
    you already see the benefits. “I believe that both the EPF and PRS can go together. I have participated in
    discussions about whether it should be A or B. But to me, it should be a two-legged approach. Now, you
    have a much stronger left foot called the EPF and a very short right foot called the PRS. We need to grow
    the PRS so that they can move seamlessly together.” According to figures released by the PPA, the
    number of PRS contributors increased from 179,250 to 221,434 or 23.53% in 2016. Ho notes that while
    the update is comparatively smaller, the number has risen steadily over the years. </p>

<p>“This may be due to the saving and spending habits of the general public as well as the mindset of most
    Malaysians who believe they have the EPF as their retirement pillar, without being aware that only 22%of
    active EPF conributors have the minimum savings of RM196,800 – which has now been reaised to
    RM228,000 (effective Jan 1) – to sustain them in their retirement. The introduction of the PRS gives the
    self-employed and others who do not have access to pension plans a flexible alternative to save for their
    retirement,” says Ho. As at last May, the EPF had 14.72 million members, of which only 6.83 million are
    active and contributing members (as at September 2016). In its annual report, the EPF highlighted that in
    25 some of the 68% of its members aged 54 had savings of less than RM50,000. It also found that only
    18% of its members achieved the minimum savings amount according to their age – a far cry from the EPF’s plan to get at least half of its members to meet the minimum savings of RM196,800 in the next four
    years. Many of the PRS funds invest in existing unit trust funds and do not have capital guarantees –
    unlike the EPF, which guarantees a return of at least 2.5% annually. To get the scheme off the ground, the
    government introduced a maximum tax relief of RM3,000 for those who contribute to the PRS. Those who
    pay the highest tax rate of 26% could reduce their taxable income to RM780 if they applied for a rebated.
    Under Budget 2017, RM165 million was allocated to the PRS Youth Scheme (for those aged to 20 to 30).
    The government has pledged to contribute RM1,000 (up from RM500 previously) to youths who contribute
    at least RM1,000 to the PRS before Dec 31, 2018. This segment had grown to 18% at the end of last year
    from 7% in 2013, according to the SC’s 2016 annual report, released on March 9. </p>

<p>The eight approved PRS fund providers in the country are Affin Hwang Asset Management, AIA Pension
    and Asset Management Sdn Bhd, AmFunds Management Bhd, CIMB-Principal Asset Management Bhd,
    Kenanga Investors Bhd, Manulife Asset Management Services Bhd, Public Mutual Bhd and RHB Asset
    Management.</p>

**The Illusion Of Having Enough ToRetire</h3>**

![](/img/2017-03-13-the-edge-future-of-prs-4.png)

<p>Although the statistics indicate that there is a great
    urgency to save more for retirement, a large segment
    of the population continues to believe that their EPF
    savings will be sufficient for their retirement, says
    Kenanga Investors executive director and CEO Ismitz
    Matthew De Alwis. “But over the past year, investors
    have become mindful of how far their EPF savings
    can support them once they do not have a sustainable
    income. Recently, the heavily debated topic of
    whether the withdrawal limit should be raised to age
    60 has let to many contributors becoming more aware
    of their EPF savings and the longevity of it,” he says.
    “However, this was still not enough to prevent many
    from falling for the ‘EPF illusion’. Research and case
    studies have clearly shown that many Malaysians will not have enough to spend during their retirement and on average, those who are employed tend to utilise
    all their EPF savings within a short period of time. In a recent study conducted by the EPF, 70% of
    contributors who withdrew their savings at age 55 finished their savings within a decade of their
    retirement.” While there are other options, such as investing in real estate, which has stood the test of
    time, De Alwis points out that cashing out of such investments is a lot harder as saleability is a concern,
    depending on the location and market timing.</p>

**“Don’t put all your eggs in one basket’</h3>**

<p>He says there is no “one single or best way to save for retirement” and that even the PRS should be
    supplemented with other investment and savings vehicles.</p>

<p>“A well-balanced portfolio includes a healthy mix of equities, fixed-income securities, real estate and cash
    equivalents, taking into account your risk tolerance level, desired investment duration and financial goals.
    The phrase ‘Don’t put all your eggs in one basket’ comes to mind here. Diversification is the key to building
    a solid retirement portfolio.</p>

<p>“That is why Malaysians need to consider a more holistic strategy when they plan for retirement, one that
    covers their financial, health, physical and social needs. The lifestyle you lead in your fifties and sixties
    could be different from when you are in your seventies and eighties. “Early savings and holistic retirement
    plans are needed to secure their future needs. Once they are able to gauge those needs, they can
    estimate how much they should be saving in preparation for retirement.” </p>

<p>While the PRS remains a low-key investment, Manulife CEO and executive director Wong Boon Choy
    points out that the scheme’s assets under management (AUM) grew from RM1.17 billion in 2015 to
    RM1.51 billion last year – outpacing the AUM growth of the unit trust industry, which rose 10.55%. “I
    believe it will continue to grow significantly as the PRS market is relatively untapped, mainly because there
    is little incentive for PRS consultants to promote the scheme as the investment amounts are usually very
    small compared with those for unit trusts,” he says. This has been a long-standing problem as agents of
    the fund providers are not incentivised to promote the PRS if the sales commissions are lower than those
    for unit trusts or investment-linked funds. While there aren’t any plans to address this issue, the PPA
    intends to reduce the paperwork involved for PRS agents, says Husaini.</p>

<p>Having to lock away their savings has deterred PRS members from increasing their contributions, says
    Affin Hwang’s Chan. However, she urges prospective members to understand the objective of the lock-in
    period. “It is to ensure minimal leakages from the person’s retirement funds as it is human nature to dig
    into the funds if there aren’t any restrictions or deterrents for things like purchasing a house, paying for
    their children’s education, medical fees and so on,” she says.</p>

<p>Annual withdrawals from the PRS can be made from the second account a year after the member’s initial
    contribution. However, there is an 8% tax penalty per withdrawal. Members are not required to provide a
    reason for the withdrawals. Wong believes that the tax relief, capped at RM3,000, has been a major factor
    in getting people to invest in the PRS. “We can confidently say this as we noticed a spike in PRS
    contributions in November and December for the past three years due to the final rush for the tax relief
    before the year-end,” he says. Chan says Affin Hwang’s PRS funds have received positive feedback, </p>

<p>particularly from those aged 35 and above. She adds that this age
    group is more acutely aware of the fact that mandatory savings
    are insufficient for retirement. </p>

**Fund Types</h3>**

<p>The Securities Commission
    Malaysia (SC) requires all
    PRS providers to offer three
    core funds – conservative,
    moderate and growth. The
    asset allocation for core
    funds is meant to address the
    different risk appetitesby age
    category</p>

<p>Investors can personalise
    and select a combination of
    funds that best suit their riskreturn profile. They are also
    given the flexibility to choose
    funds that invest in local and
    regional markets. </p>

<p>“The rising cost ofliving and inflation have changed their mindset.
    They are more focused on retirement and willing to contribute
    more thant RM3,000.” To further boost participation, CIMBPrincipal Asset Management CEO Munirah Khairuddin suggests
    that some form of incentive be made available to lower income
    groups to get them thinking about retirement planning and
    encouraging them to save in the PRS.</p>

<p>“That is because they do not see personal tax relief as an
    encouragement due to the insignificant savings gained from it.
    More often than not, tax benefits do not apply to low-income
    earners,” she points out. To reach a larger section of the Malaysia
    population, more employers need to adopt the PRS and
    communicated its benefits to their employees as well as see it as a means of retaining talent, says Auyeung. This segment appears to be gaining traction. According to the
    SC’s latest annual report, continuous engagement with employers has seen the number of corporates
    more than double to 477 in December last year from 161 in 2015. Auyeung says apart from large
    corporations, the PRS should be designed to get the small and medium enterprises on board as well. “I
    hope that the PRS providers will come up with products that encourage more participation. When the
    government first created the PRS, the point was to keep it simple so that people could understand and
    participate in it</p>

<p>“But as the market continues to develop and evolve, they may have to start thinking about products that
    can increase participation – different providers may take different approaches but to me, a PRS product
    should not be a regular unit trust product. I always draw a line between regular retail funds and PRS funds.
    The PRS is for people to set aside money for retirement, while a regular unit trust fund is an investment
    that can be redeemed at any time.</p>

**Commendable Performance</h3>**

<p>Although a large number of PRS funds have had a bumpy ride in the last three years, many of them
    performed commendably in the one year period ended Jan 31. Some even registered double digit returns.
    According to Morningstar’s monthly PRS performance report, the CIMB-Principal PRS Plus Growth A
    Fund which has a fund size of RM25,495,281 – was the top performer in the Malaysia Aggressive
    Allocation category. Last year, it registered the highest cumulative return of 14.65% out of 16 funds. The
    Affin Hwang PRS Conservative fund saw a cumulative return of 4.79% – the best performance in the
    Malaysia Cautious Allocation category. CIMB-Principal’s PRS Plus Moderate A, C and X funds were the
    best performers in the Malaysia Moderate Allocation category, all with a cumulative return of 13.34%.
    Interestingly, some of the best performing PRS funds are in the non-core categories. The CIMB-Principal
    PRS Plus Asia Pacific Ex Japan Equity A, C, and X funds came out tops with cumulative returns of
    21.58% and 21.6% respectively. </p>
